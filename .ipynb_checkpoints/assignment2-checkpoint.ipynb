      "The beer pours a viscous, blackish brown color with light brownish lacing and good head retention. This beer pours like motor oil, and has the look of a beer that has seen some serious barrel aging (which I assume it has). The nose is rich and decadent, showcasing maple syrup, dark chocolate, chocolate brownie, vanilla, light coffee and noticeable bourbon. This smells like it might be pretty good, albeit very sweet and rich. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, with the maple syrup, vanilla and bourbon taking center stage. This beer is very sweet with quite a bit of maple flavor, which is perhaps its only flaw. Mouthfeel is very full, with a long, soft finish. The beer comes across as very viscous on the palate. Carbonation is fairly low, which I think works well with the mouthfeel in this beer. The finish in this beer goes on forever. Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile, though the abv is actually relatively low for a ba stout these days. In any event, while you can tell the abv is up there in this beer, there's no heat or off flavors from the alcohol.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously, this is an excellent BA impy stout. Does is justify the hype and price tag? Can't answer that. Depends on the consumer I suppose. All I'll say is that it's a a very good beer and one I'm happy to have tried.\n",

Expectedly sweet, the toasty malts bring out the flavor of maple-dipped chocolate, chocolate covered espresso bean, bourbon ball candies and whisky laced molasses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bold, savory, sweet and mouth coating on the middle palate, the boldness of the stout remains in check while the more roasty edges pull from the sweetness with espresso roast, toasty, smoky and baker's chocolate that all trend spicy, lightly bitter and balancing with a chest warming offset of bourbon and all of its caramel, vanilla, toasted oak and peppery whisky flavors in closure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously full, rich and lavishly malted from start to finish, the stout finishes on a drying track in an off-pastry mouthfeel of spice, light bitterness and port-like warmth. It's a masterful stout that belongs on such lofty pedestals.\n",

      "On tap at TG for part of KBBS release day - rating 2023 version; perfect black color. This is an amazing blend richness, dessert and coffee; the barrel is perfectly complimentary and not overpowering. The sweetness is palatable rather than making your teeth hurt. The mouthfeel is thick and silky. Overall, one of the best beers I've had.\n",
      "Perfect black color. I didn't see much foam, other than a brown ring. The smell is a perfect blend of maple, coffee, chocolate, and bourbon. The taste is strong with maple. Almost too strong. Chocolate follows, with coffee, bourbon, and vanilla. It is very sweet. The mouthfeel is thick, smooth, lucious, and full. Very nice. Overall, this is a wonderful beer, but there is too much maple flavor for it to be one of my favorite beers.\n",
      "Amazing stout, expensive but worth the price!\n",
      "Amazing\n",
      "Cellared 5 years. Pitch black oily pour, no head. Let's start with the mouthfeel because it is basically perfect: rich full body with silk smoothness, booze warmth is at the perfect level, dark wood, mild roast, and rye all come together to help shape a complex beauty. Tastes of rich chocolate fudge, black strap molasses, leather, caramel, vanilla, earth, char, roasted malt, prune, complex barrel, finishing complex wood. Smell is more barrel forward with chocolate, char and vanilla as the leading complimentary emphases. Complex, deep, rich, and refined. Really impressed as this exceeds the hype for me, excited to compare with the 2023 bottle I have\n",
      "Have you ever been jumped at a beer in southeast ATL? If you haven’t this beer is prefect for you! It’s like an all out assault on your taste buds.\n",
      "Had 2019 and 2022. Both were fantastic vanilla came out perfectly. This beer has a great thickness and lives up to the hype. 2019 was more thick but both were anazing.\n",
      "Black thick appearance with no head, barely even a collar, no lacing. Whiskey barrel mellowed nicely by vanilla a la marshmallows, milk chocolate, and latte. Moderate to thick body, light carbonation. Delicious!\n",

      "\n",
      "It’s has more of an evolution to it in taste, and it is so damn tasty. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting chocolate fudge, sweet bourbon, vanilla bean, jammy blackberry, raisin, toasted oak, fruity coffee, burnt caramel, molasses, and light walnut.

      "\n",
      "As for looks, its your standard fare for a 14% Stout. Dark and thick looking with little to no foam to speak of. Some legs on the side of the glass, but it doesn't look too sticky appearance wise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nose is freaking superb. Oak, chocolate, cinnamon, bourbon, roasted malt that typically reminds me of street cart style pretzel, dark fruit like fig as it warms. Very mild ethanol presence which is crazy all things considered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste is nearly as good as the nose. The roasted malt, chocolate, and cinnamon come together in a decadent fashion. Like malted milk ball and cinnamon ice cream, but not as sweet. I think the peppers have been hidden by the barrel aging. They manifest as heat on the back of the throat, but not so much as flavor. The slight issue I have with this is the astringency from the barrel aging. Sometimes the barrel, the roasted malt, and the ethanol come together and create an almost soapy taste and feel. It's very silght but it still exists on the mid palate where you want the flavors to crescendo a little more harmoniously.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mouthfeel is great as well. Thick, smooth, silky, and almost fluffy. Not too cloying or oily. Some of that tannin astringency emerges as well, but not offensive. Very mild alcohol burn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, this is the real deal. Pretty much as close to perfection as a brew can get. I don't believe in an objective perfect beer, because if you strengthen one aspect you might inevitably weaken another. But this one shows true skill and care in mastering a craft.\n",
      "Rated #5 on this website for a reason.\n",
      "Newbies share 2024. I prefered the 2022 to the 2024. Mellowed out on the booze a little bit. Pepper was very nice in both and the vanilla mixed with cinnamon was very well done as well. Would happily revisit.\n",
      "Pours a rich, deep dark brown. Aroma is wonderfully sweet & intense. Equal notes of chocolate, vanilla, bourbon and chilis with some cinnamon and caramel. Taste follows and is even more pleasing than aroma. Plenty of enjoyable and well balanced flavors -- chocolate (fudge), chilis, vanilla, caramel, toffee & plenty of cinnamon. Full bodied. One of best stouts.\n",

      "\n",
      "There's more bite to it in taste but it never becomes overwhelming, it's very nicely balanced.

      "A special gift for a special moment. This did not disappoint. The darkest brown can be, brown ring. Aromas of caramel, toffee, molasses, raisin, and bourbon explode off this one, dark oak, char, leather, barley dry earth, and a touch of cocoa and anise in the background, incredibly complex. Taste has more barrel focus with the rustic wood, bourbon, earthy char and chocolate all rise to meet the level of the toffee and dark fruit, with toasted caramel, barley, and leather support. Feel is massive and heavy, also very warm but never hot, leans more malty than barley.\n",
      "Absolute phenomenal brew. Super complex. Perfect in every way. It was the star of our beercation to Side Project.\n",
      "Appearance - The beer was silky black with a reddish-tan head topping the glass.\n",

      "Smell - The nose was like boozy chocolate with notes of dark fruits. The barrel was also obvious in the nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste - Initially, big slick chocolate notes cover the tongue. There was a lot of cherry and coconut with a little boozy vanilla. It drank like a port, better with small warming sips. There was a hot burn that did not take away from the profile.\n",

However, I wanted to get a special beer to toast him with everything coinciding perfectly, even the name of the beer is perfect.\n",

      "Consumed 04/20/24, bought at San Diego Beer and Wine Company. 70$ for 12.75oz, probably the most expensive beer I have ever purchased. As always Anchorage’s label art is insanely cool. This is the 2022 variation (black and yellow label with black wax), 15.5% ABV. The description states this beer has been aged for 19 months in Woodford, Heaven Hill, and Willet barrels, then finished with Madagascar vanilla beans and raw/toasted coconuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drinking this beer with a buddy with the different variant. paired with pistachios. I left it out for ~40 mins before cracking.\n",
      "\n",
      "A&S: Jet black beer. Pretty good crack when opening, which is surprising considering the amount of aging this beer has undergone. The chocolate-colored fizzy head disappears right after pouring. The most interesting/unique characteristic of the appearance of this beer is the legs. The legs create brown oily streaks on the glass, unlike any beer I have seen. Black chunks of sediment settle on the bottle of the glass. The aroma is powerful right off the bat. My wife and mother (both novel beer drinkers took a smell and thought it was hard alcohol). The aroma consists of bourbon, dark chocolate, prunes, and raisins. Honestly, the profile fits more with a barleywine than a stout. Initially, I wasn't getting a ton of vanilla, but as it warms the vanilla comes through. To a lesser degree, I can smell coconuts and coffee. Unsurprisingly, no hop character.\n",
      "\n",
      "T&M: This is sweet stout, without much of a bitter profile. Some of the major components of this beer's taste include figs, port wine, blackstrap molasses, and barrel character (bourbon, oak, vanilla). Other tones include maple syrup and caramel. Consistent, not much changes about this beer as it warms. This beer is dangerous because you can smell the alcohol in the aroma, but the ABV is super hidden in the taste. Also no hop characters. The mouthfeel is very thick and smooth, but not chewy or velvety. The mouthfeel resembles the appearance in the sense it is a little oily. I would like a tiny more carbonation. Very warming. The mouthfeel is different than many other American Imperial Stouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall: This is currently the highest-rated beer I have ever reviewed on BA. Part of the reason I picked this beer is because I loved A Deal With The Devil so much. Overall, it was an amazing beer, but that isn't surprising considering the hype of being #5 American imperial stout and #7 overall and the price. Having said that, I wouldn't buy this one again due to cost. For almost 6 dollars an oz, I would expect something truly mind-blowing. Looking over my American Imperial Stout list I would say this is on par with Abraxas, CBS, and Grey Monday for a much cheaper price tag. I wonder if some of the hype behind this beer cost bias (aka I want this beer to be soo good because otherwise it wasn't worth spending $70 on).\n",

      "L -- As expected, intensely pitch black with a very quickly dissipating dark brown head produced with aerated pour. Less viscous than anticipated, and lowering appearance some because of some huge chunks of congealed coconut fat that plopped into the glass at the end of the pour. Recommend to decant this one.\n",
      "S -- My girlfriend thinks it smells like a Ben and Jerry's shop, and I agree. Chocolate/coffee ice cream, almond joy candy bar, nougat, vanilla cupcake, bourbon, shredded coconut\n",
      "T -- Vanilla frosting, oaky rye spiciness, wet barrel, dark chocolate fudge, dried cherry, coconut cream. The barrel character really comes in waves and is quite intense\n",
      "F -- Oily and intensely flavorful, but not super velvety. Nice level of carb. Thankfully the coconut fat chunks dissolved by swirling the glass and didn't impact mouthfeel\n",
      "O -- Really assertive, flavorful, and layered. My first Anchorage barrel aged offering and the vibe I get is that they're *really* into that wet barrel character\n",

      "Pours dense and rich. No head or lace. Nearly flat. Huge mocha legs that look more like whiskey than beer. Nose is salted caramel chocolate, lactose, fudge, and cocoa. Dense and rich. What sets this apart is the perfect saltiness. The flavors are super intense but perfectly integrated with the barrel presence. Beer opens chocolate, lactose, and cocoa powder. Molasses and hazelnut in the middle with sprinkles of espresso. Loads of barrel. Slight saltiness in the middle. Breakfast syrup with a touch of bacon. Oak and more barrel in the finish. This is perfect. Body is full with low carbonation. Slick and boozy on the palate and goes down smooth. Rich and full but not exhausting or heavy. Long, lingering, filmy aftertaste.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought I'd tasted the spectrum but this one really sets itself apart. Near perfect.\n",
      "Pours a pitch black color with no head. Only the alcohol legs stand out aesthetically. The aroma, though, might be one of the most multi-faceted yet delicate experiences I've encountered in the beer world. There's just so much going on, yet the notes of bourbon, chocolate, dark fruits, vanilla, coconut, and almonds are so harmonious and perfectly balanced, it just blows my mind. The flavor profile absolutely doesn't disappoint in the slightest, and I gave the aroma a 5! A fuckin' 5! I don't hand out 5's the way Stone Cold Steve Austin hands out Stone Cold Stunners, that's for sure. It opens with a huge hit of coconut and vanilla, revealing a midtaste of dark fruit goodness. Oak gradually appears on the back end, with a perfectly balanced hit of booze to cleanse the palate. Despite the extreme flavors, it's shockingly balanced, though perhaps less delicate than the aroma; that's my only real nit to pick, and I wonder if it's even worth picking. The feel is just a touch flat, but despite the intense, palate coating sweetness, the oak tannins and nuanced alcohol presence do enough to cleanse the palate. In general, it's extreme but somehow well rounded...the best of both worlds.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't regret spending $53 on this small bottle. Enough said. This right here - in my humble opinion - is a paragon of the beer world, and the best barrel aged stout I've ever sampled.\n",
      "Sweet milk chocolate, a hint of savory/umami, prominent vanilla, fleshy raw coconut, and a bourbon barrel nose on this one! Great aromatics here! Taste follows with a thick and velvety, milk chocolate-covered coconut, and a big, vanilla-bourbon barrel boozy heat finish. And I mean heat! Whoa! Not sure if it is this particular bottle, but that boozy backend is the only drawback IMO. This is absolutely delicious! I just wish a little more balance was given to the barrel treatment here.\n",
      "WOW, what a beer. Black as ink with a tiny brown head that leaves absolutely no lacing, unless you count the brownish staining from the charred beer. Nose is coffee and charr, but also alcohol. Taste is very chocolatey, then the warmth builds from the alcohol, however not overwhelmingly so. Very smooth beer. Great beer.\n",
      "Part of me wanted to age this for a long time. And then things in my life recently made me feel we should do what we can while we can, so maybe I should drink the hugest ranked beer I have in my collection.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s sweet, flavorful, balanced, and boozy.\n",

      "Dark, very brown edging, oil sheen top.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strong sweet notes of coconut, vanilla, toasted dark malt, and bourbon barrel so strong it can burn your nose hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste is a duel between strong booze of the bourbon barrel and the sweetness of the coconut and vanilla.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feel is the weak point here. It’s maybe too much of a booze burn, and it’s a bit sticky and thick. I’m thinking aging it would have helped, and it’s my fault for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I wanted to try this beer, and I did. Glad I did. It’s big on flavor and booze and very enjoyable for the attempt.\n",
      "Way to sweet for my palate - but I feel very blessed that I had the opportunity to try it\n",
      "2021 editiion, drank May 2022. So sweet, even the small bottle was a lot to drink solo. Ten Years was much more balanced.\n",
      "LONG time want of mine! 2016 vintage. Unfortunately, most of the cocoa, vanilla, and cinnamon has faded already. All that remains is the apple brandy, and strong ancho chilies. Spicy burn on finish. I’m sure it’s a shell of its former self.\n",
      "Bottle share thx to Hopelessly0.\n",
      "Review was for OG, not rerelease.\n",
      "Poured from a 45F chilled can into a 16oz pint glass. Clean white head that dissipates, some lacing on the glass. Appearance is medium amber, hazy.\n",
      "Aroma is that of a west coast ipa with tropical fruits and flowery hops. Taste follows the aroma with a punch in the mouth of hops ... grapefruit, some apricot, pine, some malt and biscuit in there, lingering pepper notes on the backend. Pretty well balanced between some sweetness in the front on the tongue and then bitterness from the hops on the end.\n",
      "Mouthfeel is smooth with medium carbonation and medium-light body. Not too heavy. A little chew in the mouth to keep reminding you it's still there playing on your palette.\n",
      "Overall a very well-crafted beer. First time Ive had it, very tasty. It is well-above avg DIPA, one of the better ones that I've had. Would certainly purchase again if I see it down this way.\n",
      "Look - this is an ugly, cloudy beer; probably part of the reason for the direction to drink it from the can\n",
      "\n",
      "Smell - layered floral waves; amazing\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste - this beer is liquid marijuana; the hop flavors border a hallucinogenic experience; there is no hint of fusel; despite the shit ton of hops, it is all balanced\n",
      "\n",
      "Feel - pure cream\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall - the World-Class rating is earned. This is my number 1 beer each summer in Vermont.\n",
      "I have had this beer several times and IMO it is the most overrated beer in America. Really not pleasant and bitter. Second Fiddle blew it away head to head. Hard pass\n",
      "This beer it’s kind of the standard for Hazy IPAs. I gave it 4.75 because I know that there is always room for improvement but if you wanna know what a real NEIPA taste like , this beer must be on your list.\n",
      "Discovered this beer while skiing in Stowe years ago. Little did I know it was a legendary, bucket list beer for many. So fresh tasting. A masterpiece.\n",

      "12.5% ABV.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pours a nearly black color. There's a bit of a tan colored collar ringing the glass, but no real head forms. The aroma is simple, yet extremely effective. Maple syrup literally explodes out of the glass aromatically, yet is balanced somewhat by the nuanced black coffee and roasted malt. My only complaint is the lack of infinite depth, but what's here is intoxicating. The flavor follows closely. It opens with the same explosion of maple syrup that destroyed my glass when I was inhaling the aroma. (Not sure how I'm still drinking and reviewing this...) The coffee presence feels reticent, though I do enjoy the upsurge of dark fruit flavors on the back of my palate...no, I'll just come out and say it. This is too damn sweet. Nuances are lost to the palate crushing sweetness, though the flavor profile itself is still good. Despite being absurdly sugary, I enjoy the soft, creamy mouthfeel. I wish it was drier, though. Carbonation is low. Yep...this one isn't for me. I can't give it a bad or even a less-than-good score because it does a lot of things very well, but it's just way too sweet and tiring to drink. I'd love to try the BA variant, too bad that's a literal-ass whale (then again, I never thought I'd ever find Mornin' Delight just a few years ago...)\n",
      "2023 vintage. 7.75 oz pour on tap for $13.50. Pours pitch black with a voluminous tan head. Aroma and flavor feature a TON of maple syrup, along with coffee, dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon. Sweet but not cloying. Definitely some alcohol heat which would probably become smoother with age. Obviously super glad to have tried this, but didn't quite live up to the hype for me. It's quite tasty but strikes me as a giant maple bomb first and foremost.\n",
      "Pours as dark as it possibly be. Not much head to speak of. He knows has a chard smell to it. The taste is sweet with a caramel and likely maple flavor to it. Nice warm on the throat. Wow is all I can say.\n",
      "Finally had this--one of USA's Holy Grail beers--at Henry's in Saratoga Springs, NY. Believe the hype! Jet black pour with a thin tan creamy head. Maple syrup and espresso nose. This beer glides down the hatch delivering maple sweetness, light chocolate which is then balanced with a slightly bitter coffee tannin finish. It's just flat-out brilliant. Grab one and don't let go.\n",
      "Holy Maple!!!\n",
      "A - Pours a cloudy and milky cream-cicle orange with a nice sudsy pillow of bright white head. This beer seems to have a back lighting glow.\n",
      "\n",
      "S - Citrus and tropical fruits, piney, some dank notes.\n",
      "\n",
      "T - Just an absolutely complex flavor bomb that has a tropical fruit, citrus, piney and dank hop party in your mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "F- Mellow up front, but a bit of a palate wrecker on the back end.\n",
      "\n",
      "O - This is my favorite of all the Tree House brews I was able to try. Just an incredible beer in every way.\n",
      "Gifted can from Drew. Extraordinary NEIPA.\n",
      "For my self I’d like to think this is a very top end NEIPA vs IPA. Having had King JJJuliusss and Julius on tap at TH… this seemed like a unique great brew somewhere between the 2. Not surprising but no less wonderful.\n",
      "Pour produced rich plumy white head which dissipated fairly quickly with little lacing but a decent thin halo. Nose is pleasant fruit…mangoes and straw. Taste brought in orange but creamy not pushy citrus. Likewise the other fruits in the base malt/hops combination had a creamsicle vs raw fruit taste. I found it inviting and excellent. There was residual resin on back end that worked. Overall a superb easy tasty orange creamsicle with some mango, papaya and passion fruit with a complimentary mild dank. Body was very smooth, slightly thin for DIPA… and supported by a some medium bright soft carb.\n",
      "Again a big complex and delicious brew that seems like a great NEIPA. It does not nor need to be considered a DIPA considering all the examples then/now from other excellent breweries.\n",
      "I found this less complex nor or taste; not as big/ full but considerably more tasty than King JJJuliusss I had earlier this evening.\n",
      "Definitely what I could say is the King Julius is one of the …if not the best NEIPA… I’ve had for those brews that are full tropical plus dank. Highly enjoyed. Grateful to have tried.\n",
      "Pours a cloudy cream orange with a finger of foamy head that slowly dissipates to a thin ring with plenty of lacing. Aroma of orange and mango. Taste follows nose. Full-bodied.\n",
      "Appearance - The beer was hazy yellowish orange with a fluffy white head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smell - Light citrus notes came from the glass, mostly orange.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste - Initially, the taste was big orange. It was smooth and almost fluffy like some thing from a juice bar. The finish was slightly dry and almost oaky. I was grateful it didn’t have that peppery sensation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mouthfeel - The body was thick, allowing Orange to claim the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall - This is not my favorite Tree House.\n",
      "The grown up, \"I'm only having one drink tonight\" version of Julius.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's all good, no complaints.\n",
      "huge thanks to a friend for bringing this all the way across the country for me. crazy to be drinking the 12th highest rated beer in the world according to this prestigious website! i have to say, rarity aside, as delicious as this is, its hard to really class it that high, i can think of numerous others that play in this same space just as well, the super hazy majorly dry hopped strong new england ipa style, without half the fanfare, which is not a critique of this, and rankings are subjective and all of that, more a neat thing to consider while sipping it than it really being indicative of superiority, which is totally fine, i feel lucky to have the opportunity to enjoy a can with a pal! slightly murky to even a little dull in color, dense but not with visible sediment, and the head is as creamy as rich whipped cream, dense and lasting, really crowns this nicely, almost belgian looking but thicker. the nose is cool, tangerines, peaches at peak ripeness, new school sativa buds, white grape and pineapple hard candy, almost a confectionary sweetness, not malty really to me but im sure there are some oats in this, cereals under all the hops but simple also, orange juice and mimosa, light vanilla, light greenness from all the hop pellets, seems fresh, bold, grassy too as it sits, intriguing and definitely original, as is the flavor. definite orange julius vibes, i think thats a fair claim for this and good branding, appropriate. navel orange, its full essence, orange hard candy too, again with some sweetness and vanilla that doesnt seem to come from malt, center of the palate, enhancing the hops, which are super saturated in this but only faintly vegetal. green grape, new tennis balls, peach rings, lemon sorbet, and well grounded by the dry grain. some late bitterness but more juicy hoppy than biting, and the whole thing is positively pillow soft, effervescent, and distinctive, it stays on the palate awhile too without being a bruiser, its got body but the alcohol is out of the way, and of course the quality is near the head of the class. i think its ranking is odd, there are others this good and better out there, its a hype driven thing that keeps fueling itself, but it was killer to get a chance to finally drink this. very good.\n",
      "L - straight up looks like a slightly darker orange juice with a frothy white head that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving behind a good amount of lacing\n",
      "S - soft tropical fruit notes - tangerine and mango with orange and pineapple with faint hops\n",
      "T - orange citrus, tangerine, mango, pineapple up front and throughout with a slight hop presence, though no bitterness. Good amount of malt to tie things together.\n",
      "F - medium, leaning on full bodied with moderate carbonation. Soft, very smooth. Juicy\n",
      "O - this one took me by surprise at first, and maybe not in the best way. It's such a different beer from other tree house NEIPAs in my opinion because its smoothed out hop profile. The hops are present but there is no bitterness or abrasiveness at all, combined with the very present citrus - mainly orange and tangerine - and tropical fruit notes - mango and pineapple, make this a very smooth, yet somewhat subdued beer. It's pretty fantastic, but I think my preference leans towards Very Hazy overall and standard Julius to this\n",
      "This one is highly rated so I was expecting fireworks. They weren't forthcoming.\n",
      "It pours dark orange with a nice thick head, but really not much of a nose.\n",
      "Mostly it has notes of wood, with a little malt and also papaya.\n",
      "Listen, it is a good beer. If this would be the only beer to drink in the entire world, I would be fine with it. But I didn't find it to be such a standout. Badlands Brewing in Ontario beats the bejeezus out of it, any day, with several of their offerings.\n",
      "Truly lovely.\n",
      "Cracked open the can. Immediate notes of a proper hazy. OJ, tropical notes. Check. Very opaque and cloudy yellow orange with a flash of a white head and ton of carbonation on the side.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sip is like something illicitly good. The immediate nanosecond of a sip you can tell what's about to happen. It's opulently smooth and you want more before you even when you haven't finished a mouthful yet. The description is apt in that any bitter or abrasiveness has been completely tamed and just bows down to what your taste buds want to hear: smooth tropical juice. Anything counter to that smoothness has been surgically excised. It's very strong and extremely smooth for the ABV with no noticeable alcohol save for some build up of heat while drinking. It's interesting because there is still some level of hop fire but it's extremely smooth and pleasant. It's great.\n",
      "Batch 11 - 2023 (black wax) - just a superb beer. Pours a deep, dark brown color with an amazing nose of barrel and caramel / sweetness. Taste hits you with perfect balance; that's what sets this apart - it's as if the entire beer plays nice with all of its parts, intense flavors of barrel, sweetness, raisin and caramel, complimented by dark fruit and brown sugar.\n",
      "I might say it's a smidge thin for me, but that's if I'm TRYING to find a flaw. It's the embodiment of a perfect BA barleywine, IMO. Right up there with MJK and 10 Yr BW from SP. I think 10 Yr BW edges this out by the narrowest of margins, but let's be honest, I'm not turning either down given the chance to have it again. What a beverage. One of those beers that you were almost pissed that you decided to split it instead of solo-doming. :)\n",
      "Briljant beer and worth searching for.\n",
      "In the nose - a really nice and complex smell that longs for another sniff.\n",
      "Taste- complex, sweet but not overwhelming, caramel, tannins and vanilla from the barrel.\n",
      "Overall- excellent flavor and taste, not unbalanced in anyway.\n",
      "Thank you to noblepudding, a prince among traders, for sending this fancy, gold-waxed bottle to the northern steppes. 375ML, Batch #7.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pour is a muddied brown-red with the expected lack of bubbles. The nose is a sharp spike of bourbon & booze.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Deal with the Devil – Triple Oaked is a multi-layered beast. The booze is off the charts for a malt-based product & the bourbon exhale is spectacular; if I drank the stuff I suspect I could pull some of the various bottles out of the layers. Underneath that glorious noise is black, bruised, sweet fruit just on the edge of gone, molasses, achingly sweet, before the desiccated oak brings it home. Shame this bottle is so small. I have lots of sick/vacation time to use on three of these in a night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, damn. Anchorage rarely misses on their big bottles & they better not based on the price point. This is transcendent.\n",
      "Pours a deep, dark brown color. Aroma is an amazing, complex combination of dark fruits, oak, bourbon with hints of caramel and a tad bit of coconut. Taste follows nose but with more intensity of flavor and sweetness -- the dark fruits (fig and plums), brown sugar, caramel, bourbon and the oak. So very balance and very present in the taste without distracting from the other flavors. Full bodied, traditional ADWTD mouthfeel. Incredible barleywine and worth the wait.\n",
      "2021 batch 3, drank in June 2022. Didn't get as much from this as previous ADWTD. Felt sweet without complexity that you would expect. Still very delicious, just not worth the price.\n",

      "Beautiful copper flecked golden coloration. A gentle pour from the cradle agitates minimal head; this one is quick to settle flat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nose is fantastic. A bright introduction of lemon zest and floral honey play contrast to distinctly musty, mildly cheesy notes on the back end. There's an orchestrated balance, and the interplay between those touches of ammonia and oak with the zesty citrus and punches of honey sweetness make for a truly special aromatic intro.\n",
      "\n",
      "The palate is a masterclass in oak treatment and blending. While time has brought such delicacy to this inaugural batch, there's still a noticeable sharpness. An initial punch of lemon rind and oaky dryness opens the door for a previously dormant acidity to surge into the mid-palate. The finish leaves with it a soft puckering to accompany low bitterness and a whisper of ammoniated funk.\n",

      "T - Follows the nose: bright, piney, resinous hops intermixed well with citrus - a good amount of orange along with grapefruit with a nice malt backbone to tie things together. Biscuit and some honey notes as well. Some grass as well. Very clean tasting.\n",
      "F - medium leaning on full bodied with moderate carbonation\n",
      "O - Like pliny the elder, nothing seems extreme or overdone with this beer, despite being an amped up version of PTE. It's just incredibly well balanced and well done. One of the best TIPAs out there.\n",
      "The color is golden with a tiny head and lace.\n",
      "The aroma is a fruit basket with piney hops.\n",

      "Taste: richly malty and a bit sweet, but with lots of bitterness backing it up. There’s a little fruity character here, I’m thinking from fermentation, along with some piney/grassy notes from the hops. It’s interesting — a rich flavorful beer, but neither as cloying nor as harsh as TIPAs often are. Worth the hype? Maybe. But certainly a good beer.\n",

      "Mouthfeel: medium body with a good level of carbonation and creaminess.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall: I like this beer a lot, and I bet if I’d tried it 15 years ago it would have blown my mind (and my palate). In today’s IPA climate, competition is tough and we as consumers are spoiled. That said, this remains a really tasty beer.\n",
      "Not sure what else needs to be said about this beer, it's pretty close to perfection for the style. A little on the light side, piney and bitter with a touch of sweetness. Intense flavors and very very smooth.\n",
      "Pours golden yellow with slight white lacing crown on special edition (once a year) draught at Malibu Wine & Beer. Notes of honey and crisp perfect hops, slightly sweet with a perfect hop punch. This limited batch hard to get pour drinks like a single IPA but checked in at hefty 10.25% ABV putting it into triple IPA category. CHEERS to Russian River and the perfect IPA.\n",

      "Bottle share with Rob. For me this is about as good as beer gets. Wonderful mouthfeel and coconut flavor.\n",
      "2023 bottle. Aromas and flavors are dominated by coconut; not sure if this bottle was off, but got a heavy alcohol bite up front. It mellowed mid palate, but still was offputting. Very thick and smooth from a mouthfeel perspective. Honestly enjoyed Batch 3 of the non-ba version of this better than the 2023 bottle. Shame I missed 2019 at Stout Week - was hoping to compare.\n",
      "2023 vintage. Pours nearly still and super syrupy in the glass with noticeable congealed coconut fat in suspension. Not exactly the most appealing, but definitely sets the stage in terms of viscocity. This is easily the most coconut-forward beer I've ever had -- both the aromas and flavors are dominated by intense notes of shredded coconut, coconut macaroon, and coconut ice cream. Quite perceivable booziness in the aromas in particular, but things are smoothed out by the liquid brownie batter character in the flavors quite nicely. Hugely thick, velvety, and viscous, the mouthfeel is only knocked down a hair by the near-cloying sweetness. It's definitely a punch-you-in-the-face kind of beer. Leaps and bounds beyond the other coconut-forward BA stouts out there? Not really. But it is damn decadent\n",
      "\n",
      "85/100\n",
      "Had on site draft from the brewery. Lucky it was on tap while I was there, but as with most pours on site (not just at AC), it was ice cold. Gave it the appropriate time to warm. I have had the non-ba version. The barrel definitely helps the tooth curdling sweetness in the non-BA version. I think it's great on the nose, but even as a BA stout, this is still a little too sweet for me. I think 5 years ago I'd have thought I went to heaven and died having this. In 2024, my palate just likes less of these adjuncts, or a much smaller pour. Great dessert stout, no question, but I think my palate just likes this type of beer less than it used to.\n",
      "Unbelievably delicious desert stout. Highly recommended!\n",
      "Had after having the non-ba version. Yeah, the barrel helped! Instead of a sugary finish, now there is a sweet and booze concoction. The barrel isn't complex but it smooths out the balance here, allowing the coconut, vanilla and chocolate to shine without any getting too strong. Smell really shows this off, where taste the cumulative sweetness does start to get on the radar. Still a very good dessert stout\n",
      "My bottle was heavily infected. 2022. Anyone else have this happen?\n",
      "11/23/2019 - poured from a 22oz bottle into a Morning Delight snifter. I cracked this beer to celebrate my first 3+ mile run after recovery from achilles surgery in May, 2019. Loved everything about this (booze, vanilla, thickness).\n",
      "This was a great beer. Had it on draft with my buddy on Black Friday at Goose after picking up our bottles from Binny's in 2019.\n",
      "Hot on the heels of that classic Bourbon County Brand Stout flavor and the need to reach new heights, Goose Island keeps the wholesome goodness coming with both vanilla and rye. Amplified creaminess, richness, and smoothness all come to the forefront for the most succulent of stouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The monsterous stout pours an oily-inky and truly viscous pour of blackness with brownish legging. Formitable early head formation falters underneath the enormous gravity and alcohol of the beer. Completely opaque, the beer draws you in with most seductive of intent. Mouthwatering aromas of bitter cocoa, espresso, burnt toffee, maple syrup, brown sugar, and unmistakable rye whisky. The warming beer emits scents reminiscent of dark fruit, licorice, stone fruit and wood spice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sultury flavors of chocolate wafers, creamy vanilla, molasses, and sweet barrel nuances blend together for a flavor that's quite like Bourbon Ball candies. Walnuts, robust coffees, and port-like fruitiness continue to contribute new layers of flavors with each and every sip, and all wrapped in a soft vanilla envelope. Incredibly powerful in flavor, the sweetness of malt is seemingly amplified by the vanilla and reduces the roast flavor to that of mocha latte and less like true espresso; helping with the harsh roast but allowing for a heavy, icing-like sweetness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimate fullness, richness, and oily- stouts don't get much bigger. The beer coats the mouth similarly to heavy sweetened fortified liquors like cognac, port, or honey liquors. Sweetness masks the alcohols, allowing for a high level of drinkability despite its alcohol content. Very warm, but never harsh, the beer is a true desert with each sip and gives a long bourbon/chocolate linger time after time. A long and savory aftertaste of roast and vanilla come with the woodsy, peppery and earthen grit that's special to rye barrels.\n",
      "Pours a dark mahogany brown color with an unfiltered look, and settles in the glass with a nearly black body and a soapy tan head that dissipates pretty quickly, which isn’t surprising given the 16.8% ABV. Absolutely gorgeous barleywine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first note on the nose is an intense oak aroma that is a product of the boozy barrel note that follows, then lush, decadent caramel and toffee notes, and just a hint of stone fruit as plums and a bit of raisin. I am slobbering on myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The taste has all of the components of the nose, with the luxuriously decadent caramel and toffee flavors up front, the oak cutting the sweetness, and the plums a smidge of tart fruit that is a perfect finish coasting into the boozy warming at the back of the palate from the barrel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mouthfeel is rich, full, and decadent, suiting a beer of this gravity like a glove. This is a tippity top world class barleywine that I can’t recommend highly enough. Truly magnificent.\n",
      "A big thank you to Quinnimical for knocking this 12 oz. can off my wants list. And since I pretty much want everything Revolution ever makes, I’m sure it’ll be replaced by 3X Barrel Super Ultimate VSOJ soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pour is even darker than regular plain old VSOJ. The bouquet is intensely alcoholic, shedding bourbon & spicy rye all over the interior of my nasal cavity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Double Barrel V.S.O.J. is a true sipper. The grossly understated 14% ABV hits like Joey Browner in his prime, suffusing all of the senses, including a few I didn’t know I possessed. Rye dominates, bourbon places second, then the barleywine tries to get a few words in with brown sugar, toffee, caramel, molasses, with sharp oak on the finish. Well, other than the alcohol finish, of course. I wonder how much of this I could drink before my brain waves flatlined.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes massive barrel is just massive barrel. Sometimes it’s beautifully integrated with a great beer. This is the latter. A masterclass in barrel aging that, well, I can find no flaw in. In sixteen years of searching the world, here is my eight perfect beer. I love it.\n",
      "Had on tap. V.S.O.J. is one of my favorite beers of all time. So there is no way this can meet that bar.... right? Expand the barrel character of vsoj and add more gushing caramel up front, resulting in a taste that is the epitome of barrel candy with enough barley and oak to balance. Body is lush and stupid smooth with plenty of booze backing. Smell is the one area that is simpler than the orignal just because the barrels are so strong (and beautiful), fitting my conclusions of the beer: it is more potent and deep, but not as complex and drinkable, a very warm sipper that is so rewarding. The wife loved it. Well done rev again!\n",
      "Darker in color compared to straight jacket. Very smooth with so much depth. Compared to the regular straight jacket, this one is far more robust, less sweet, but with heavy prunes, toffee, bourbon, and even a hint of white wine. No alcohol burn so you have to watch yourself!\n",
      "sampling a 12 oz can poured into my snifter at cellar temp. Date stamp is 12/29/2022.\n",
      "The beer pours a dark rich mahogany color into my glass. Only the lightest tints of light get through the glass.\n",
      "A fizzy beige head of 1 cm foams up but fades to a thin edge layer quickly after the pour. The edging does stick around for most of the sampling.\n",
      "Aroma is toffee, brown sugar, some bourbony/rye sweetness, a bit of dry wooden barrel, almost like a popsicle stick note. There are hints of fusol booze here too, but no hop notes that I can detect.\n",
      "First sip reveals a fairly robust body and syrupy texture. Carbonation is fine and tingly, sticky coating on my palate after each sip. Swallow reveals a bit of warmth on the finish. Physical traits make this a sipping beer.\n",
      "Flavor is similar to what the nose predicts with malt forward character. I get toffee, brown sugar and general malt sweetness. There is a rye/bourbon note that carries through for sure and I keep tasting maple syrup, even though I dont think thats an additive. I dont get any hop character on this beer. Booze is limited to warmth, with no peppery bite or spiciness.\n",
      "A sweeter sipping beer that I am enjoying and very happy to have had the chance to drink tonight while watching Dallas vs Seattle.\n",
      "12oz. Can I to a BBT snifter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pours coca cola. Near flat. No head, no lace. Super thick, oily lace. Nose is rich and aromatic. Notes of nutmeg, hazelnut, brown sugar, and molasses. Booze is apparent but subtle. Beer opens chocolate, brown sugar, anise, and dried dark fruit. Molasses, barrel, sweet cream, and breakfast syrup in the middle and end. Oak, some tobacco, and burnt brown sugar at the end and aftertaste. Body is medium to full with low carbonation. Slick and oily on the palate and goes down rich and slightly boozy. Dry, lingering aftertaste that goes on for days.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the perfect English Barleywine. Insanely well integrated and complementary flavor profile with a body to match. Incredible.\n",
      "500 ml bottle into a snifter. The 2023 edition, had 7/27/24.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pours near black and opaque, with a slight head and a light oily smear on the glass. Aromas of vanilla, chocolate, malted milk balls, malt, some oak, light bourbon, a little char. The barrels make a bigger appearance in the flavor, which is more focused: bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, malt, some oak. Smooth, somewhat creamy, a solid full body, appropriately carbonated but a touch fizzy feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "A standout. Have had this a few times at events, quite delighted to finally obtain a bottle. All that delicious vanilla leads the way here, of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "RFOB18 0471\n",
      "Pours black and thick with a dark chocolate colored foaming.\n",
      "Smells like malt and dark chocolate, with a touch of bourbon. Maybe a little licorice and figs. The bourbon may be loverpowering the vanilla in the smell, as I am not getting any vanilla smell. (Note: after coming back to it a few minutes later, the bourbon has mellowed and the vanilla comes through really well.)\n",
      "Taste is delicious. The vanilla comes through here, even with a bit of a bourbon flavor. The dark dried fruits flavor comes through nicely. The malt flavor is good.\n",
      "Feel is not quite as smooth and viscous as I expected. It’s still good, but not as good as it looked when pouring. The carbonation seems to give it more fizz than I would like.\n",
      "Overall, a great beer. I suggest letting it air a few minutes after pouring, then drinking a bit, then come back to eating it. It seems to change quite a bit from first opening to 5-10 minutes in, for the better.\n",
      "Received a 2022 bottle from @Beersnake1 3-13-23. Reviewed 12-14-23.\n",

      "\n",
      "Nose is awesome as i am getting a medium roasted malt base that absorbs the rest in the bourbon barrels which lends notes of cocoa and bourbon. The vanilla adjunct is very prevalent and lends a nice tangent-4.5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste is a medium roasted malt base that gives a big dose of vanilla up front with the barrels lingering in the background. With subsequent sips the blast of vanilla is coalescing with the barrels and am getting cocoa presumably from the choice of malts used. Finishes almost sweet but hopping and the barrels take that away-4.5.\n",

      "It’s very similar in taste and I have absolutely no complaints about that. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting chocolate fudge, vanilla bean, dark bread, caramel, medium roast coffee, sweet bourbon, charred oak, raisin, brown sugar, and light molasses. The swallow brings notes of toasted oak, molasses, vanilla bean, walnut, dark chocolate, medium roast coffee, black cherry, burnt caramel, sweet bourbon, and raisin\n",

      "Oh man, this one absolutely lives up to the hype! I was a bit hesitant given how sweet it is, but it remains very balanced throughout. Great stuff\n",
      "Pours a deep, dark brown color. Aroma is a wonderful combination of rich chocolate, deep vanilla with hints of bourbon and dark fruits. Taste is really intense combination following nose -- dark chocolate, strong vanilla, fruity and bourbon flavors. Mouthfeel is full bodied. Overall incredible stout.\n",
      "2022 vintage (batch 8) served in my Bruery snifter. Pours one shade shy of black. Complexion is opaque. Head ins loose and mocha-colored and quickly disperses into a tight band around the shoulders and an oily slick across the surface. Nose is decadent vanilla, caramel, cocoa and spirits. This is going to be decadently sweet! Taste follows nose - spirits are subdued and only come out at the finish. The rest is just pure candy. Mouthfeel is medium in body with a semi-still carbonation. Overall, an amazing imperial stout.\n",
      "500ml capped bottle into a BBT snifter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pours with a 1 finger dark mocha head. Beer pours heavy, pitch black, viscous. Sticky, mocha legs. Nose is chocolate, vanilla, molasses, and barrel. Pungent and rich. Beer opens chocolate, vanilla, and fudge. Hints of cocoa powder and roasted malt. Big barrel overtones. More vanilla and molasses in the finish. Body is full with low carbonation. Sticky and viscous on the palate and goes down warm with a long, lingering, sticky aftertaste.\n",

      "S - peach and tropical fruit notes with piney hops, though the hops are subdued compared to Very Green\n",
      "T - Peach and tropical fruit notes (pineapple and mango) up front and throughout with some citrus notes - grapefruit and orange - intermixed well with piney, slightly bitter hops. Solid amount of malt.\n",
      "F - Full bodied with moderate carbonation. Pillowy soft\n",
      "O - a pretty incredible NEIPA. Soft and full bodied with more peach and tropical fruit notes compared to Very Green which favored more bitter hops with tropical fruit notes and a less full body.\n",
      "Deep orange in color with a thick white head. Nose is full on citrus and grapefruit. Taste is like nose, citrus of oranges and then grapefruit billows across the palate. Very soft feel, nice bitterness that builds then fades.\n",

      "The feel is mouth filling (okay, I may have gulped this a couple times...) -I expected more particulates but found none, it was such a soft yet quaffable beer that I had trouble drinking it slow enough to focus on what I was tasting.\n",

      "Extremely tropical nose. I am hit while pouring the beer with tropical aromas. Up close I get a big hit of pineapple and mango.\n",
      "Taste - The flavor is dominated by the hops. The hops are quite tropical. I get a huge pineapple hit, and it is backed up by mango. There's a bit of a pleasing bitterness on the backside.\n",
      "Very juicy feeling. Very soft. Very full feeling. The hops do cling and linger in my throat.\n",
      "The hype is real. This beer is totally solid and delicious.\n",
      "The look is very hazy gorgeous apricot orange, with a thick off-white, busy-looking, foam top. The smell is incredible. Vibrant orange, peach, grapefruit, and mango scents jump from the can, and explode when the beer is poured into a glass. The flavor is mildly sweet orange juice, peach, grapefruit, mango, lemon, and jackfruit. The mouthfeel is thick, soupy, soft, and smooth, with medium carbonation. Overall, this beer is worthy of its rating. It is one of the best NEIIPAs available.\n",
      "Pours from the bottle black with a fizzy 1\" head that quickly dissipates, very little lacing. Nose is black licorice, molasses, dark fruit; charred barrel; alkaline cocoa powder, chalky roast, blackstrap molasses as it warms. What doesn't come across is coffee. Taste essentially follows - dark roasted fruit (stewed figs, cherries, and plums); woody barrel; salty licorice and molasses; dark chocolate. As it warms, boozier bourbon elements emerge (bourbon, vanilla, smoke, char), but still, very little coffee flavor. Mouthfeel is far lighter than other BCBS variants, and there's some prickly carbonation to boot. This is certainly a nice sipper, but as a coffee adjunct stout, it doesn't measure up to many in its class. Additionally, there are ample non-adjunct stouts that express more coffee flavor than this does.\n",

      "\n",
      "Appearance - Virtually black from the bottle and into the glass. A half finger of deep tan head is poured and fizzles out in about 60 seconds. A tiny collar of foam lingers a bit longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smell - Nuanced aroma with huge bourbon notes, cocoa powder, nuts and fresh coffee beans. Vanilla and molasses in there as well, but akin to walking into a local independent coffee shop. Exceptionally robust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste - Up front there's dark chocolate, some coffee, bourbon but not overplayed. Coffee, cocoa powder, vanilla afterwards. Sweet but not too sweet. Some sips bring much more bitterness with molasses playing a prominent role.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mouthfeel - Full bodied, but exceptionally light on it's feet. Low carbonation with a nice warming touch in the back of the throat. There's a powdery texture at times that combines wonderfully with the cocoa powder flavor that feels so light.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall - Hard to say which I prefer between BCBCS and BCBS, but this is a wonderful coffee stout that pretty much lived up to expectations and hype. Not likely to purchase again soon given the hefty price tag and difficulty in obtaining it, but a very worthwhile endeavor that every BA should strive to sample if only just once.\n",
      "Fresh BCBCS hits hard every GD time.\n",
      "This Brand, particularly with the Coffee, has gotten too carried away with itself and left me behind. It's all good, but it's not all this good to boast a 4.67 average... and certainly isn't World-Class in my book. In particular, the coffee is too prominent. Stouts are about blending malts, not blending coffee. Dark malts and coffee are usually at opposite ends of the day and for good reason: they really don't complement one another much, except in a very narrow range and with some brewer's luck.\n",
      "\n",

      "Nose is rich and intense. Robust aroma of dark chocolate and molasses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste pretty much as expected, but sweeter. Tasting chocolate syrup, malt syrup, dark brown sugar, cocoa nibs. Very little detectable coffee presence, just a hint of vaporous mocha along with the smoky bourbon late in the sip and in the sinuses.\n",

      "375ml bottle that is waxed with thick bronze/gold wax. Poured into Durobar Charente with SP light bulb logo glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Appearance: Midnight black body that has a small amount of dark brown head that collects near the outside of the glass. The head is short lived and eventually you have a black mirror on the top of the beer. Legs on the side of the glass along with lots of little black specs that cling to the side of the glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smell: Rich chocolate cake. Rich bourbon with big barrel char. Marshmallow fluff and vanilla beans. The smell to me is actually more impressive than the flavor profile and that's no insult to the flavor of this BBA Imperial Stout.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste: Dry dark chocolate notes and moderate roasted malt notes that resemble a fresh brewed dark roast coffee. Big barrel char & smoke hits next transitioning into a rich note of bourbon that is sweet, but not too sweet. Floral vanilla beans that do not taste overly sweet, but add a deep richness to the overall effect. Slightly dry oak barrel in the finish. Perhaps some molasses, leather, and tobacco notes as well. As this beer warms up the chocolate notes really sweeten up in the best possible way from dark chocolate to an Oreo cookie type flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mouthfeel: This is a full bodied Stout; not pastry thick, but as thick as you can get perhaps 1 notch below pastry thick. It's definitely motor oil; very silky and velvety in its texture. Low and adequate carbonation levels. No booze to this at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall: This was an excellent pick as my birthday beer. Pappy barrels really do some amazing things to barrel aged stouts. Everyone knows this would be a banger for the SP barrel program.\n",

      "The beer poured a syrupy and thick, deep mahogany hue. A mass of lager sized, saddle brown bubbles topped the liquid, but they quickly dissolved. The resulting body was shimmery and viscous and looked very similar to a spirit. After each sip, thick, sticky legs trickled down the sides of the glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aroma was really intense. Uber malty and robust. Super boozy and complex. Brown sugar and dark fruit notes came through big time. Huge booze soaked raisin presence. Loads of stewed plum character too. Woody bourbon and port notes were prevalent from start to finish. Good dose of vanilla as well. The alcohol presence continued to intensify as the beer warmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flavor profile mimicked the nose. Massively boozy and intense. Tons of dark fruit character. Like in the aroma, booze soaked raisins and woody bourbon notes dominated. Moderate roasted malt presence. Brown sugar was noticeable on the front end. Port notes appeared in the center. More boozy, oaky bourbon stave character on the back end and in the finish. Somewhat dry and tannic after the swallow. Sweet, boozy, bourbony notes and some woody char lingered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nice rich, syrupy mouthfeel. Full bodied but definitely not quite as viscous as I anticipated for a beer of this magnitude. Loads of alcohol heat. The liquid contained a super fine, mellow effervescence that worked nicely for the style.\n",

      "A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged is unquestionably the most intense barleywine I have ever tried and an impressive example of the style. That said, the alcohol presence was almost a bit distracting. This is a beer that would likely be best enjoyed when split multiple ways with friends.\n",
      "Single, Triple, now Double Oaked in the books. A 16 oz. can the likes of which I’ve never viewed, with the bottom of the can slathered in black wax. Funny, guys.\n",

      "\n",
      "A Deal with the Devil – Double Oaked harkens more towards III than I. The slyness of 1 is absent here, while the gullet-searing booze of III is popping. Cluster of bourbon greets the palate & it’s smooth, not harsh, an easy guest. Mid-palate is full, sweet, thick maltiness, anise, molasses, caramelized toffee. Belches bring up more delicious bourbon. Thick; close to sludgy. Neither that nor the future promise of a morning head-pounding would keep me from drinking a couple if I had them. Luckily, I do not.\n",

      "This series is ridiculously good & crazy pricey. But like the other pair I’ve sample, this is a top-tier brew. In other words: yummy.\n",
      "12.7 ounce wax capped bottle, Batch #5. Label says aged 7 months in Woodford Reserve Double Oaked barrels, then transferred to Willett bourbon barrels for an additional 11 months. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a very dark brown color with about a half inch tan head that didn't stick around for too long. Not much lacing at all. I like the aroma, the brew smells like dark fruit, bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, caramel and toffee. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some oak and molasses flavors. Mostly sweet tasting but not overwhelming at all. Nice oaky/woodiness lingering in the finish. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's coating and syrupy with a moderate amount of carbonation. A little boozy, but doesn't seem like it's 17% either. I thought this was a pretty good barleywine, definitely worth trying if you get the chance! I know I'd like to try some of the other variants one day.\n",

      "Canned 7/9/24. Bought at the brewery 7/21/24. Poured at 56°. Super fast fizzy lite tan head that vanished before I could snap a pic; no cap retention save a small island of micro dots, no ring no lace; thin legs at best for 14.4% abv. Caramel malt and sweet bourbon nose. Taste is sweet caramel malt and bourbon, sugary raisins, plums and dark fruit (cherries); some oak/vanilla in the finish. Mouth warmth from 14.4%, light carbonation; creamy medium heavy body; smooth, lux feel. Overall, this BBA BW is the real deal; surprised after all these years of enjoying this beer I’m just now reviewing … buy. drink. enjoy.\n",

      "Blend 3. Hill review number 100 for me! Definitely leans towards the Flora side of things with a noticeably higher level of lactic and wheat-driven tartness than many of the Hill wine barrel aged offerings. Has that wonderfully complex English muffin-like sweetness from the malts and a decent amount of oaky astringency as well. Really great, but maybe not better than the sum of its component beers\n",

Beer opens lemon zest, apricot pit, with a slight touch of butter in the back. Funky towards the middle. Hints of bread, yeast, and peppercorn. Tart lemon seed in the finish. Lightly puckering aftertaste. Body is light with ample carbonation. Prickly and lively on the palate and goes down zesty, dry, with a long, lingering aftertaste.\n",

      "This is a blend of Flora, Art, and Ann, so it’s not surprising at all that this is really good. Having had all of those at this point, I wouldn’t say any one beer entirely stands out – this becomes its own thing that stands completely on its own, and might be better than each of the three titans that contributed. It’s very oaky, and orange-like, with a hay-like dry finish that is just so refreshing. There’s also stone fruit, white wine, dried lemon peel, with a restrained and very pleasant acidity.\n",

      "Jet black and pouring like ink, Chemtrailmix alerts the nose with a strong, savory and sultry blend of coffee, cocoa, whisky, spice, port wine and sherry.

      "\n",
      "As the stout extends across the middle palate, the sweetness slowly turns to dry. A rise of espresso, baker's chocolate, roasted nuttiness and campfire char keeps the session hefty before the spices of cinnamon and peppercorn tease the palate with a gentle dry prickle. Trending warm with rye whisky and oak, the late palate trends coconut-like with vanilla, earthen grit and caramel with those savory aged port and sherry savory qualities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Full bodied, pleasantly chewy and off-cloying, Chemtrailmix finishes malty-dry, spicy and very warm. With impressions of sherry and coconut lingering in aftertaste, this calls for a long, patient and sipping session with high rewards and a surprising rate of drinkability if you can tolerate the combination of whisky and spice.\n",
      "Pours a pure, coal black color with a sudsy dark tan head that is fairly quick to flee. The nose features the cinnamon up front and with extreme prejudice - this is bigly cinnamon. There’s also a nice spicy note from the peppercorn and some chocolate and a subtle barrel note.\n",
      "\n",
      "The barrel is more pronounced on the taste, and a perfect, spicy complement to the peppercorn flavor - and the still bigly cinnamon, which is delicious. There’s also chocolate and a surprising bit of stone fruit. There’s a LOT going on here and it’s all magnificent, IMHO.\n",

Fou'Foune pours light gold with a modest pure white head. Fruit forward in the nose, and lively and effervescent like champagne on the tongue. Flavor tiptoes up the the line of tartness, then backs off and is replaced by sweetness. Apricot and citrus doing the tango on your palette. Savor this.\n",

      "Gifted a can from Drew. Huge full fruit forward DNEIPA. Massive. Thought the look was a bit too full and a bit murky. But this was as advertised. A huge “in your face” bomb of flavor full of pineapple, orange and resin. The thick dense white head fits with the heavy punch of this beer. The nose is citrus, sweetness and dank.\n",

It definitely has some tropical citric goodness expected of a hazy here, but even more prevalent is a spicy hop character with a vegetal herbal component. I would venture as far as to say that while most hazies are hazy in the tropical sense, this one is hazy in the hop bite spice floral herb sense. Very gggreen indeed.\n",

      "2017 Vintage. Pours near black with a robust 2\" head that settles to a solid cocoa cap, thin streaks of lacing. Nose is coffee grounds, cocoa, baking chocolate, roasted barley and malt; very light barrel and maple at this point. As it warms, a little more maple character, along with some light soy. Taste remains well balanced even after 6+ years - maple sweetness, malt/roast, tannic barrel; cola-like citrus sweetness. Remarkable how well this has held up. Feel is light for the ABV and compared to other adjunct stouts. Having had so many imitators, was expecting the original to pale in comparison; instead, it not only held up, but surpassed the competition.\n",
      "2018 vintage, review from my untappd\n",
      "Appearance: Pours a completely dark color with a massive dark tan head that pillows and lingers. (4.25)\n",
      "\n",
      "Aroma: Strong aromas of cocoa, coffee, bittersweet notes upfront. Balanced and complex. (4.25)\n",
      "\n",
      "Flavor: Strong flavors of cocoa and chocolate upfront that balance with coffee. Then a sweet and rich chocolate, bourbon, and maple flavor follow. Sweet with a mild coffee roast off the finish. (4.25)\n",
      "\n",
      "Feel: Heavier-bodied, strong carbonation. Mild roast. Smooth, heavy, but balanced and not too sweet. (4.00)\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall: First try at this World-Class rated Stout. Founders doesn't make bad ones so have high expectations. The pour is beautiful. Aromas are spot on. Chocolate, coffee, yet with a complexity you can't describe. Backs it up on the flavor with the addition of some maple, honey, and bourbon sweetness. Still complex with a balanced finish. Not sure why they held this one back and why it's not easy to find, but this could easily be an annual release. I've learned to try every stout from Founders without question. (Rating: 4.23)\n",
      "Deep, rich pour. Nose is maple and bourbon, chocolate. First sip brings up the coffee and bourbon, dark chocolate follows close behind. Long finish. It's beer heaven.\n",
      "I always find it hard to believe they can make this taste aged when it's freshly bottled. Years ago the maple would be strong unless you waited on it. The last few years the maple is perfectly blended. Magical...\n",
      "I don't know what to say about this vmbeer that isn't already known. Founders makes some amazing stouts and this is one of their best. I cannot recommend it enough.\n",
      "This is sublime. I lack the experience or vocabulary to call myself a connoisseur or expert rater of beers, but at the moment I’m drinking this, it could be the most delicious beer I’ve ever had, even better than the Belgian quads I love so much. And when you get right down to it, any beer — or any food, any experience — that is this transcendentally satisfying deserves to be thought of as one of the best.\n",
      "Pours a deep brown with ample tan head. It smell like chocolate, dark malts, maple. The taste is chocolate, maple, a little coffee, some wood, barrel, a little dry with some hops.\n",
      "One of my favorite beers and certainly stouts and it is a smooth beverage that is dangerous drinkable, cheers!\n",
      "This is a 2018 vintage bottle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pours opaque dark brown to black but with red and amber highlights on the edges when held up to light. Hefty khaki head that persists, falls to a modest cap, but foam coats the glass beautifully.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aroma is great, but maybe subdued by age. Coffee and sweet chocolate, bourbon barrel and vanilla, base stout and very faint maple as if warms up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste - coffee, chocolate on the sweeter side, just a touch of bourbon, some vanilla and the maple shows up late but blends jn smoothly. All on top of roasty base grains and the OG stout. Superb, smoothly integrated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feel is thick but not syrupy or sticky. It's not highly carbonated. Luxurious and smooth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tremendous beer - not much more thst one can say about it.\n",
      "Should be near the top of the 250 list. The gold standard of BA Barleywines begins with this one. At 17% abv, the booze is well hidden beneath layers of toffee, leather and barrel.\n",
      "Great late summer beer thanks to the copious presence of apricots, especially in the aromas. Looks and tastes like your standard American wild ale: lambic-like, acetic, and not particularly well balanced in terms of allowing the local terroir to shine\n",
      "\n",
      "71/100\n",
      "Very acidic. Subtle apricot. Based on this vintage, I prefer WA.\n",
      "Sample at de Garde 10th Anniversary. Cloudy golden pour, small bubbly head. Aroma is stone fruit and grapes. Taste is fruity, tart with lots of funk and barrel notes.\n",
      "Fantastic golden hue and white foam head that emits a fresh apricot orchard like aroma. The aroma is a burst of freshly cut apricots and a hint of funk. Flavor is initially the fresh apricot flavor that's mostly sweet with tartness coming in behind it. The finish though is overwhelmingly sour. Great overall but acidity is strong with this one which detracts a bit from the sweet apricot fruit like notes I enjoy most.\n",
      "On tap at Sabatinis in Exeter pa late this afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Splendid looking beer. Faintly hazy golden body. Strong persistent white head, which leaves spectacular lacing. Aroma is hoppy, fruity, mostly non citrus. On tasting, at times sweet, other times bitter. Strongly hoppy, but rests on a solid malt base. The abv at first isn't that noticable, but it sneaks up on you. Finish is warming. Mouth is full.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, an outstanding drink. Only a long drive home prevents me from having another 2 or 3.\n",
      "Pours a light copper color with a finger of head. The nose has citrus notes upfront with some pine in the background. The flavor profile has bright citrus notes. Oranges are predominant with a trace of lemon as a nice accent. The body is a bit light for a big IPA.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is quite good, but I'm not sure it lives up to the hype.\n",
      "From brewery - canned October 2/23 - 6 days old.\n",
      "Uniformly hazy burnt to brownish orange golden colour with a half finger of short lived just slightly off white head.\n",
      "Nose is floral, some honey like malt; strong citrus notes - orange, red grapefruit - soft tropical fruit (mango mainly) with a hint of vanilla and piney resin. At one point questioned a bit of soapiness.\n",
      "Sweet citrus on the palate - orange, but also a good whack of pithy grapefruit, some grapefruit peel bitterness coating the back of the mouth admixing with piney resin flavours.\n",
      "Creamy and smooth, rich full mouthfeel - carbonation brightly pushes throughout the body - pithy bitterness lingers with the juicy sweetness.\n",
      "Such a well balanced beer. Hill Farmstead doesn't go crazy with one flavor profile and that is embodied here. While labeled a NE IPA, is more caramel colored than hazy and tastes blend west coast and east coast styles, similar to Focal Banger. Definitely hoppy at the start but mellows with a malty, oaty finish. Partly hoppy and partly rustic, Abner is a expertly minimalist IPA. They do all the little things right.\n",
      "6/25/25 FINALLY! On tap at THE Lawson's brewhouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beautiful citrus overtones. Vanilla, peach, and soft lemon aromas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazingly smooth, bitter, slightly sweet. Vanilla, stone fruit, lemon rind, and grapefruit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Listening to smooth blues on a cool summer evening!\n",
      "Double Sunshine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The beer. The myth. The legend.\n",
      "\n",
      "The beer that spawned an entire series of Sunshine-themed (mostly) IPAs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sip of Sunshine is one of the best shelf-available IPAs in the nation. Little Sip packs one heck of a punch for the ABV. Triple Sunshine is a legend in its own right. And on and on and on, each take fantastic in its own right.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Double Sunshine is really the OG.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flavor profile leans citrus-forward, but there's a hefty amount of pine, resin, and tropical fruit to provide balance. The malt base is clean and smooth. You'd likely never guess that both DS and SoS clock in at an identical 8% ABV; while the latter drinks like a single IPA (that will knock you on your ass), the former truly drinks like an imperial IPA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Double Sunshine is one of the purest expressions of an Imperial IPA - before the NE-style craze, but not aspiring to be a Pliny clone, either. Entirely worthy of the hype, and then perhaps some.\n",
      "On tap at Sabatinis in Exeter pa early this evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lovely bright golden body. Head gradually shrinks to a fat collar and covering. Magnificent rings of lacing. Aroma is hoppy, mildly tropical. On tasting, initially slightly sweet, then a massive grapefruit assault\n",
      "Quite bitter. Loving this. Finish a lasting dry grapefruit bitterness. Mouth is full.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall. Been hoping for this one, and it did not disappoint. 1/2 barrel tapped 4 hours ago.\n",
      "Poured into a Spiegelau from a 16 oz can.\n",
      "\n",
      "Look: Vibrant yellow-orange with a slight amber hue. Rocky, foamy white head with significant lacing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smell: Hop punch up front with juicy, tropical aromas muddling in. Slight vanilla and maple syrup at the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste: Hop explosion. Citrus up front with an almost creamy quality, quickly followed by a classic IPA hop bite.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feel: Incredibly smooth. A light prickle on the tongue with a creamy mouthfeel and finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall: A terrific double NEIPA. Truly excellent.\n",
      "Poured from the can into a Lawson's branded tulip/goblet glass. Canned April 26th 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beamin juicy orange colored body, with a touch of haze and light visible carbonation. Three finger forming head, a bit of soapy and big bubbled appearance which pops easily, with light retention. Still manages to stick around and leave a tall collar as well, making a nice crowned appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Delicious aroma. Hop pressing front nose with light citrus, and faint touching juicy tropical notes. A nice creamy touch almost sweet vanilla, mixing with a light caramel and crispy malt quality. Comes off like hinting of light powdered sugar on fruity pancakes quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mouthfeel on this is just unreal. An intense solid backbone that is creamy with just a light touch of pushing sweet tones on the palate. The mid hits with thick THICK controlled orange and pine notes, mixing sweet cream and orange, and pine/earth heat. Bitterness comes in the finish, so ever slowly, with first notes of tangerine and Christmas spices, then with lingering notes of pepper and wood bitterness. Campfire like warmth in the back palate, that just slowly sits and churns with all the orange and spices you can imagine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fantastic IPA, and hardly any hint of big abv now that I think of it. Just killer stuff.\n",
      "i know these guys have expanded a lot in recent years, so these arent quite as ungettable as they once were, but its still so sick to get to drink through a bunch of these special ones i never thought id have the chance to try, and this one is as advertised, a crazy ramped up version of the original julius and still recognizable as such, but beefed up in every way. the pour is pretty still, but its really hazy and dense, not quite with visible sediment, but definitely with a grain stew look about it, high creamy white head from the sexy pint can, a deep orange color to this with very low glow. the aroma is epic, mandarin oranges from the can, peak juiciness, along with ripe mango, tangerine, and cut flowers, slightly herbal, low bitterness, subtle white grapefruit, quince, and even vanilla, exceedingly fresh and appealing, maybe faintly yeasty but in a way that works with all the other elements, not at all distracting. the flavor is killer too, saturated to the max without being forced and without having harshness, which is such a tough line to walk, but its done masterfully here, they have a formula and its safe to say it works and is working. seems like citra on steroids, like on the edge of irresponsible, and there is a major fresh squeezed orange juice thing going on with a little lemongrass there too, not sure what hops are actually at work here, likely a couple of varietals anyway, but its a lovely mix. some juicy nectarine, white wine grape, and candy-like new school sativa here, some oils staying on the tongue past the swallow but not too green and hardly bitter at all for how hop driven it is. i also think its cool that the alcohol is held back, usually at this hop intensity these are doubles or imperials, so i appreciate the drink a few of them strength, although this is still a pretty filling brew and a big commitment for the palate, if not the blood alcohol level this time. soft feeling and holding and extending the hop climax beyond just about any ipa type ive ever had, its at max for a long time, epic. light coconut, pineapple, and general tropical warmth as it sits, juicy and delicious as can be. perhaps just a bit more grain to this than i need in the mouthfeel, but its hard to be critical at all of a beer this good, ideal freshness in my experience too, thankful for the family friend who stoked our beer fridge with tree house gems, this one was memorable!\n",
      "From a week-old can, pours a hazy deep, rich orange. Big dense head of foam. Smell starts with a blast of orange citrus, then develops into tropical fruits and a touch of resin. Taste follows. Smooth, rich feel that you'd normally expect in a IIPA. Exceptional.\n",
      "750ml capped bottle into a Side Project snifter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pours a slightly cloudy ruby red. Spotty and stringy lace with a 0.5 finger coarse, white head. Nose is raspberry jam, oak, and a juicy sweetness. Lightly funky. Beer opens lightly acidic. Seedy raspberry. Light lemon zest, clean, lightly plastic funk. Juicy in the middle, accented tartness in the finish. Filmy, puckering finish. Body is light with ample carbonation. Prickly on the palate and goes down sticky, accented. Long, messy finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clean, juicy, and plenty funky. This is really nice.\n",
      "L - reddish orange with golden hues and an off-white head that dissipates quickly leaving behind no real lacing\n",

      "T - bright raspberries up front and throughout with Brett funk, oak, lactose,\n",

      "07/21/24 draft @ FlipSide Hudson\n",
      "Served on tap in a pint glass\n",
      "Appearance – The beer is served a hazy orange-yellow color with a small head of white foam. The head fades over a moderate level of time, leaving a touch of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.\n",
      "Smell – The aroma is strong of tropical fruit smells of pineapple, mango, and papaya, along with a good showing of orange and tangerine. Other smells of a bready and doughy smell mixed with some light spice and some notes of pepper and lemon are there as well, mixed with some notes of melon and a good showing of pine and herb.\n",
      "Taste - The taste begins similar to the nose, with flavors of a bready malt mixed with some flavors of tropical fruit of mango, pineapple and tangerine. The hop is present right from the start, heaviest in pine and herb, but containing notes of a grapefruit and floral hop as well. As the taste advances a bit of wood and some light notes of grass, vanilla, and hay join in, all while the malt and the hop grow a bit stronger, leaving one with a rather nicely hopped and somewhat more malty taste to linger on the tongue.\n",
      "Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is on the slightly chewier and thick side with a moderate level of carbonation. For the style and the tastes, the feel is nice and makes for a dangerously easy sipper.\n",
      "Overall – A rather nice imperial hazy. Big flavor, but good balance. Not as spectacular as the reviews may suggest, but overall quite good and well crafted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update: 6/26/24\n",
      "Had this from the bottle as well. Born on date of 05/21/24 so only 36 days old. Very similar to the brew above. Good solid brew.\n",
      "Quality brewer but this one did not work for me at all. Very course and not all the good stuff offered in IPAs today. I've enjoyed some imperials but this one falls in the \"too much for me category\".\n",
      "Picked-up two bottles at Maine Beer Company in Freeport for nine dollars. My eighth brew from these guys. Bottled on date of 11/7/23. Very good, very expensive.\n",
      "Not sure how I never rated this one previously, but just as good as the other times I've tried it after all these years. Pretty phenomenal across the board from the beautiful clear golden pour, to impeccable balance, to smooth drinkability and a super clean finish. It's a work of art.\n",
      "Hazy goldenrod with leggy white film; flowers, candles, canary melon rind and white grape on the nose; biscuit, honeycomb, white balsamic, light oaky vanilla, horse blanket, a hint of honeysuckle, and vague barrel; light, spritzy, dry.\n",

      "Bright and flowery, with a piquant thread of lemon zest. A bit heavier and woodier than a Belgian version would be. The only thing missing that I can notice is any effect from using red wine barrels.\n",
      "This is a proper gueuze. Did it benefit from hitting the market back when 3F and Cantillon were extremely hard to come by? Yes. Is it still worth chasing? Also, yes.\n",

      "\n",
      "S: lemon meringue pie, key lime pie crust, the bready and doughiness of which takes a moment to blossom, but then matches the potency of the funk, while nutty yeast and barrel wood eventually accents the edges... fairly textbook aromas, but certainly an overtone of citrus-kissed floral honey\n",
      "\n",
      "T: pop of bright, perky tartness upon initial contact swiftly trailed by crackery, grainy malt; just pummels the palate from the outset... settles into a cocktail of these dominant flavors, taking on a Bee's Knees vibe... aftertaste is a dry, tart lemon-honey cough drop thing\n",
      "\n",
      "F: pinging, puckering bite up front, quickly followed by silky, slow, near slimy malt nectar... the legs and residual drag in the finish never abates, start to finish\n",

      "At long last! It was always scandalous to me that the top rated gueuze on this site was from outside belgium, and while I still feel this is not the best gueuze I have ever had, I can now see why it is in that echelon of the style. Cloudy yellow pour, finger of sudsy white foam, good mix of spotted and splotchy lacing. Lemon, sliced tart apple, lacto, barnyard funk, white grape, flowers, hay and earthy oak in the potent nose. Taste is just as potent, but not as complex as the sour notes lead more than the barnyard funk, oak backs the sour fruits well, slight earth, yogurt funk, and decent hay round out. A more sunny disposition for the style, leans sour more than funky but both present in spades, but the body is light and nuanced despite the potency. I would love to age a bottle of this as I think it would age really nicely!\n",

Essentially perfect. 5\n",

      "Seeing the tape get pulled off the menu listing for the 2020 bottle at the Cantillon bar definitely got the old heart pumping. As the freshly, horizontally uncorked bottle rested in its lambic basket, it began to slowly push a soft mauve foam out of the spout before I gave it a tilt to pour a damn near smoothie-like stream into the glass. There it displays fully opaque garnet with a dense cotton candy head.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said St. Lam was the juiciest Loon? Scratch that, this is like Schaerbeek puree with mild hints of cinnamon marzipan delivered on a pillowy body with a surprisingly balanced acidity. Even still, a complex oak tannin brings us to a bone dry finish before exhaling a touch of black pepper and perhaps chevre. A delicious candied quality further emerges as it warms.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not sure I ever imagined just what made LPK the highly coveted fruited lambic that it is, but clearly, that distinguisher is decadence. This is undoubtedly the thickest lambic I've ever had, and in all the most delicious ways.\n",
      "Cradled 750mL bottle served in decanter, sat for ~20 minutes, then served into glass. Pours a rich burgundy color with a finger of pink foam. Aroma is cherry forward, but not in a fleshy, fruit forward way, instead delivering a rindy dark pit. It's morphs into notes of almond and cinnamon, with light tart cherry and stone just beyond. Complexity is notable, without any overtly sugary tendencies. Flavor profile delivers those same almond and cinnamon notes. Cherry is present, with a tart twist. Stone, followed by big lemon zest and grassy notes play the outro. Again, the complexity and depth is just amazing. For a beer blended with cherries, it develops much more nuance and thought beyond this single note. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a consistent grit throughout. It verges on bubbly, at least at the onset. Overall, cherry notes here are just a delight, swirling together with almond and cinnamon for a thought provoking sip. It refrains from every dipping into overtly tart or sour.\n",

      "The taste does not disappoint! It follows all of the notes from the nose almost to a T! Extremely maple forward, but the bourbon and coffee cut the sweetness beautifully! Touches of burnt oak and coconut balance things out well. A slight bitterness from the coffee was a pleasant surprise.Delightful!\n",

Definitely fortified by candi sugar. A dash of hot cinnamon. Anchored by minor base notes of warm cocoa and yeast atop a moderate base of grain.\n",

      "Clear and yet very dark brown body, opaque in the glass; head pours out fizzy but stabilizes to nice 1 1/2 finger thick head, light khaki colored. Fantastic aroma of brown and candi sugars; brownies; roasted nuts; mildly perky spiciness augments all the other smells. Stupendous flavors; deep caramel and nougat notes; honey; brown sugar; a bit of boozy undertone; no real bitterness per se, more of a phenol bite.\n",

      "It's a murky dark brown color, bordering on black at its darkest point, but the highlights are a lighter shade brown rather than ruby. It's like the color of banana bread crust.\n",
      "Not much visible carbonation in the glass. The head is small, beige, creamy, and patchy. The head doesn't seem to dissipate at all; it was just never that big to begin with. But it's sticky, latte-like froth, and swirly.\n",
      "Upon further swirls, it generates a larger head that stays.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alcohol tickles my nostrils immediately with warmth. Prune and fig stands out, dried cherry and raisin, allspice, clove, and hay. A bit of overripe banana, banana bread, some type of woodsy bark, perhaps oak and tannins. Gives off red wine vibes. Upon another whiff and thought, huge tobacco aroma, with perhaps a touch of vanilla. There's some sweet caramel and toffee or butterscotch that melds seamlessly with dark brown bread and banana. Think of it as dried and musty stone fruit trail mix in a cigar humidor with baking supplies. It smells like it's from a cellar. Amazing. Perhaps it's the power of suggestion, but it smells like it came from a monastery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The taste is more subdued than the nose. Interesting. It tastes very strong and almost boozy. It tastes like bourbon soaked raisin, banana bread, some prune, and large amounts of clove and pepper. Some hay and oak tannins. The alcohol warmth takes over the palate and lingers with heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mouthfeel is smooth, silky, creamy. It coats the palate. The carbonation isn't extremely high compared to other Belgians, but it moves the beer on the palate nonetheless. The palate is left feeling sticky with some residuals sugar and ethanol, though not overly so. It's not cloying at all. Dries off quite a bit. The alcohol taste lingers.\n",

      "Overall? Well, of course, I'm grateful to have ever tried this. This was my number one whale. So my prejudice preceded me. It is very good, but arguably, not any better than some of the other widely available quads. In fact, I'd say some of them are equal or better. But this is still great, and what an experience!\n",
      "Dark brown quad colour, but clear, no haze. Very nice tight darker than white head. Smell is malty, caramel and spice, with a little something I can't quite name. Taste is the same with a smooth feel even though the beer retains head very well. Very nice, though unsurprisingly not quite worth the hype.\n",
      "poured from a 330mL bottle into a st bernardus oversized wine / belgian glass. medium brown with light brown edges and a huge light khaki colored foam head. huge esters / phenols on the nose with some rye and caramel. taste follows. barely any hint of the abv until it finally hit room temp. really smooth and good. lots of rye spice to my tastebuds. thick mouthfeel. slick and making it all the easier drinking. this was great. long-time want for me and it delivered big time.\n",
      "Having found the original to be good but not great, I was curious to see how the barrel affected the proceedings, at last I know thanks to the power of bottle shares! Oily black pour, no head. Aromas of potent hazelnut, coffee, coconut and most of all dark chocolate meet the bourbon powerfully, slight marshmallow, vanillins, and malt in the background, wow. Taste is still a diabetic nightmare, but the bourbon barrel does help balance more, thus less coconut and marshmallow, more dark oak, hazelnut, coffee, and an addition of caramel compared to the nose. The feel just has so much residual sugar, making a shellac over any barrel depth, malts are smooth. An opulent dessert of a stout, only in america\n",
      "Sweet milk chocolate, slightly malty, hazelnut mocha coffee, nutty coconut, and a subtle bourbon barrel nose on this one! Taste follows with those chocolate and hazelnut coffee notes upfront...and then a hint of coconut and hint of bourbon barrel finish. This is showing just a touch of age as the previous pour I had of this was over a year ago and the coconut notes were much more prominent back then. It seems that the mouthfeel is a touch thinner as well. This needed more coconut, more barrel, and more viscosity to hang with the bigbois, but this is still very tasty.\n",

Smells of bourbon, molasses, dark chocolate, roasted malt, with supporting aromas of vanilla, brown sugar, dark wet wood, and leather, wow. Taste starts with baker’s dark chocolate, molasses, a hint of licorice and leather, then bourbon, vanillins, plum, lighter roasted malt, and charred wood. Feel is smooth and thick but not heavy or sludgy, roast is felt more than tasted, warm before cooling off through the sip, refined with intentional rustic glimpses especially the barrel. To answer my own question, yes it does, it is not just a blank canvas on which masterpieces are made, it is already a work of art on its own\n",

      "\n",
      "Looks like the Midnight Mother's own inky essence getting poured into a glass. I don't think you could stir any sort of bubbles out this with a whisk. I do enjoy when I can see how viscous a brew will on that first pour though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nose is huge oak, bourbon, and booze right out of the gate. Powerful as hell. Storming out of the glass. The roasted malt and dark fruit are right behind in line trying to get out. This is a turbocharged, naturally aspirated stout.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now on the taste is where we get more of a story. Oak and bourbon, first. Then the roasted malt, dark fruit like raisins, incredibly dark chocolate, wisps of vanilla, and a slight hint of coconut from the barrel influence. The barrel really just dominates in every aspect of this brew.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mouthfeel is where it gets divisive. The texture is to die for. Silky, rich and smooth, but the alcohol screams off of your palate like water on a hot skillet. This is a damn hot brew. So if anybody has the 2024 version, either age it for a year of two, or slow slip this with a nice book over a day or two's time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall this is a monster brew that could have used a little time in the cellar. The flavors are potent, but maybe lacking in some nuance due to how the ethanol comes out of the gate swinging. Give this one some time, and I think you'll be better off.\n",

Has that same deep syrupy black appearance, the same expressive aromas of nougat, marzipan, brownie batter, vanilla, marshmallow, coconut, and bourbon barrel, the same sweet but not cloying milke chocolate/nougat/espresso/marshmallow flavors, and the same viscous mouthfeel. Just everything is a bit lighter, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Overall fantastic all around, glad to finally be checking off this long time want.

      "This one pours a fairly clear golden orange color, with a small head, and a bit of lacing.\n",

      "This is my biggest white whale, the beer I have most wanted to try since first trying Hill Farmstead originally 10 years ago. It’s tremendous, just about as good as it gets for saison, but, it wasn’t even the best beer I had from Hill Farmstead on my recent trip. That’s how high the bar is for this long-time favorite brewery of mine. This has soft, subtle, and richly complex flavor to it. There’s the obvious honey, almost like honey-soaked pears, or something like that, with white wine, Riesling grapes, melon, apricot jam, and a floral and minerally funk. All of these flavor descriptions make it seem like it’s a super strong and intense beer – it really isn’t. It’s really delicate, and rewards slower sipping and enjoying.\n",

      "really special stuff, one of the best bigger ipa types ive had from these guys, and worthy of its insane scores here on BA, its one of the softer feeling strong hazy ones out there, its bold as can be on the hops, carrying much more bitterness than is standard too, but staying well away from over hopped harshness of any kind, vegetal burn, or that supersaturated thing where its permanent on the palate. this is off dry and not super malty, but somehow retains its balance, fluffy feeling and airy, but well structured and supportive too, and the carbonation is excited and the bubbles are tiny, the mouthfeel is an essential feature of this, really impressive specimen! quite cloudy with a real starchy look to it, deeper in color, rust to even light copper, lots of body but also lots of head, as high as you want to make it with the aggressiveness of the can pour, pure white, creamy, and lasting, cool whip textured, only slightly intimidating overall. i get mango and coconut in both the aroma and flavor, with supporting notes to both senses of ripe peach and apricot, floral raw honey, and straw and hay, major harvest time vibes to this, orchard fruit character, a tropical juiciness, really clean compared to how it looks, intentional in every way, killer water chemistry which is a theme with their hazy stuff, thats part of the magic, has to be. the alcohol remains well hidden even as it warms, there is a light woodiness to this too, almost how centennial sometimes hits like milled pine boards, but im not sure what the hops are here, and its well fruity the whole way too. lightly bready on the grain side, wheat likely, oats maybe too, this is rather sturdy. i get an almost concentrated hop intensity, but there is no burn, which suggests to me a hop product, cryo or something, id love to know more about it. so soft in the texture, not as filling as i am making it sound, spritzy the whole time, and just downright delicious, aftertaste of good weed, herbal bitterness, and more coconut. so good, one of my favorites from a big run through a lot of tree house four packs!\n",
      "Poured from a can into a pint teku glass\n",

      "Smell – The aroma is heavy of a raw and green hop smell with lots of grapefruit and pine hop smell mixed with herbal hop notes and some nice green grass smells. Along with these smells comes a good showing of tropical fruits with notes of pineapple, guava, mango, and tangerine. Other aromas of peach and nectarine and a bit of apricot. Along with these smells comes aromas of pepper and spice, as well as some\n",
      "Taste – The taste begins with a mix of bready malt paired with the raw hop that was in the nose. The hop is biggest of a raw and very green pine and herbal hop flavor, but is complimented by a little bit of grapefruit and notes of a floral hop. The tropical fruits are not as big as I would have anticipated from the nose, playing an accessory role to the bready malt and some stone fruit flavors of peach and apricot. As the taste advances, some grass and spice join in with the spice being of a white pepper and coriander flavor. At the very end, the raw hop fades a touch, and a little bit of alcohol and wood join in, leaving one with a still very green and raw hopped, slightly malty taste to linger on the tongue.\n",
      "Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is quite thick and heavy with a carbonation level that is on the moderate to slightly lower side. For the big flavors and raw hopped nature the feel is good and makes for a slow and savorable sipper.\n",

Here SP has done well to allowing the juicy peach tones shine too. Smell is damn impressive: sour peach, yogurt, barnyard, and barrel funks, bright and rustic oak, pressed flowers, dry earth, a touch of lemon and lime zest, and finished with big hay. Taste is more sour and less complex with funk losing the barrel variety to the sour fruits, otherwise the same with sneaky complexity yet potent. Feel is sour and decently acidic, but gentle, dries out with various funks, almost feels more pungent than it tastes or smells. Clear yellow body with a pinky finger of white foam. This is right up there with the best peach wild ales, little less acidity and it could be the very top\n",

      "\n",
      "In taste it starts off with a balanced tartness similar to the aroma, and on the back end explodes with an aggressive flash of tartness before settling down once again. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting jammy peach, lemon juice, vanilla, wet hay, straw, smooth oak, leather, and white grape.

Howbeit, an irksomeness to turns offers lace docility, as the intervals thermally protract. There’s a touch of transparency upon the settlements of course, while effervescence becomes a mobilized variance\n",
      "\n",
      "S: Pierced rusticity for white peach with esterification authorities. Illustrated by, a bitingly tart eruption that’s tamed enough for the developing – wild yeast – appearances. The progression opts for some grainy malt to the motivated horsed phenols, which quietly idle funk steps. Principally, satchels and farmstalls with soiled mold. Nonetheless, acidity is tenacious on fruit bouquets, as the lactic stability is detrimental to frowzy quirks. There’s elements of solvency thru the open air drafts, which incriminate nail polish and naphtha agents. On the other hand, that piece is often stupefied, given the peppery phenol attunement to floral hops, and biscuit-y malt brackets to stone fruit minerals\n",

      "T: A clean, consecutive, punch-down stomp that puts natural peaches in vanguard. Notations subtly follow in ripening depictions of Goldrich apricots and Armking nectarines, while briny minerals perimeter Neptune grass. In correlation, an engine for Eugenol to promptly pump in cloves and nutmeg, while maintaining that peppery attenuation. The ongoing drive is earthy and persistently bright, with calming acidity on the advances of rural funk. To that end, the move adds haystacks atop the citrus connotations, but keeps that musty jazz in a distant place. Aerial attacks begin setting in, from oak dragged elasticities, and prompt in some leathery satchels. Whilst, Chardonnay attenuates a staleness for Budapestlängd with an oxidative nuttiness\n",

      "M: Does not puncture with puckered acridity, but rather maintains a level of energy that rationally aids. Namely, a backend for rustic brettanomyces, and a pillar for biscuit-y grains.

Thus, cleanly bright with minor overextensions in the presetting bites, but pleasingly uplifting in the dry – erosional – reliefs\n",

      "O: Showcases clean peach natures with a caustic effervescence that’s costly to the preliminary entwines, of wild yeast. Though, development is rapid enough to calm the impaling authorities, and make rational moves. In this situation, light malts provide an aid to earthy hop kicks, while acclimating spiced esters with musty phenols. The approach is thereby tart with brett funk complexions, and spurs wooded fruit tannins on an astutely dry/crisp exhibition\n",

The beer undergoes a huge transformation in color when the sediment is poured in, it goes from bright tangerine to ruby orange-red. The aroma is moderately strong and pleasant, but pretty one-dimensional, stone fruits and citrus (nectarines and tangerines). As a side, the cork doesn't have much of an aroma.\n",

      "but no real Brett character, no barn-yard, or oak. I did enjoy that it wasn't overly sweet. The mouthfeel is very fizzy, and spritz-like. Alcohol is very well hidden for being 8%, however, I also never felt like I got an 8% ABV buzz. Good effervesce. It was likely bottle-conditioned since it had more carbonation than I would expect after being aged in barrels for a year and in the bottle for 2 more years.\n",

      "Overall: Initially this beer was just above average, it opened up a little, and my rankings changed a bit, but overall I have to say I was disappointed. I thought the quality to price point was about right, but to be currently ranked #7 for Saisons, I just felt like it never came close to reaching that for me. It lacked the funk.\n",

Taste follows with a well-balanced, slightly briny, oak and under-ripe tart nectarine finish. The oak barrel is pretty well integrated at this point...I was just hoping for a little more jammy-sweet nectarine on the palate. Delicious!\n",

This is currently the 5th highest rated Saison on BA and 52nd overall. Those are some impressive stats. Also, I’m not sure if I’ve ever seen a beer fruited with only nectarine, it’s usually a blend. Let’s get into it\n",

      "\n",
      "Oh man, the funk is even punchier in taste, but not in a way that's out of balance. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting tart peach, lemon juice, white wine vinegar, stone, sharp oak, nectarine, wet hay, honey, and lemongrass.

      "The perfect barleywine ale. Enjoyed this pour at Hill Farmstead in March 2024. The vintage was 2019, then aged two years in bourbon barrels. Copper colored liquid with the most minimal trace of bubbles around the glass. The nose brings out caramel, bourbon and oak, but the flavor...! Deep, deep flavor. Dark fruits--raisins, figs, dates with a mild woody backbone--I dare you not to close your eyes while sipping. Absolutely brilliant barleywine experience.\n",
      "2016 bottling.\n",
      "Bottle generously shared by Seth. Dark brown pour with a kaki head. Big booze and caramel malt aromas. Big booze, caramel malts, and dark fruit highlights. Wow, this is fantastic. Mild oak and vanilla sub tones. Complex with a great body and mouthfeel. An incredible example of this style.....\n",
      "Hard to believe I’ve missed rating this classic for so long. Here goes…. From a 12 oz bottle dated within 5 months of consumption, into a Perfect Pint glass. Engine oil brown color with thick brown tan head with slow fade leaving some clumpy lacing and a thin cap. Nose of sweet malts, dark chocolate, a little coffee, dark fruit (raspberry?) and peppery spice. Tastes malt-coffee chocolate forward with some dry bitter hops at the end wrapping things up. Balanced toward the dry bitter hoppy end of the spectrum. Mouth is not as thick as I would have expected, but still moderately viscous. Alcohol is well masked; this one can sneak up on you. Overall – I’m not sure I’d rate this as “World Class.” I looked back at my Breakfast Stout notes and see that I had a similar reception to that one. Still very good, definitely recommended.\n",
      "Colossal victory of a beer. A bulldozing pioneer of quality and creativity. A pillar of its class, and a massive source of pride/credibility for Founders. This beer will end your night and you might literally find yourself skipping drinking tomorrow. (?????) it’s just that heavy of a beer. Don’t hesitate to split a 12oz four ways! Richhhhh. 12.5abv\n",
      "\n",
      "Fruit and whisky and chalky sooty flinty vibe, almost metallic, but pleasant, caramel, toffee scents effuse from the glass. Very cold (39f) hard pour gave .5cm thick mocha head (not bad for 12.5%abv) settling into bubble islands and a cinnamon rim.\n",
      "\n",
      "The beer is succulent, roasty, supple. Huge carbonation for the style and size. Massive in so many dimensions- but quaffable at a very cold temp. Gets more flavorful, sweeter and thicker as it warms somehow tho lol. Leathery, faint char, bakers chocolately, insane choco malt richness, whispers of vanilla and spice, huge coffee / espresso, tons of barrel… all somehow in balance. Layers. A masterpiece. YUM!\n",

      "Very disappointed in this beer. Was expecting a lot. Not very drinkable, i struggled my way through it.\n",
      "I do like this beer a great deal. I haven't had it in awhile, but in 2018 I remember thoroughly enjoying this brew. It had all the right aging, balance, dark coffee/chocolate flavored malt, and hidden alcohol. So, it is definitely at my top 5 stouts I've had of all time.\n",
      "This is the standard imo of my favorite beer style. It checks all the boxes of a great Imperial Stout. Thick and dark with a tan head. Aroma so satisfying that it takes effort to pull your nose away from the glass. But you do bc you know of the party that awaits your tastebuds. This is one of the most delicious beers I’ve ever had period, any style. A dessert in a bottle. I would drink these every day with every meal. But I don’t, bc my liver would hate me.\n",
      "Excellent flavorful deserving of high rating.\n",
      "The booziest stout I've ever had, and I've had plenty with higher ABV. Nice complexity. Brownie and vanilla notes. Very solid but not especially impressive. Breakfast Stout is better and much cheaper. Must have been amazing when it first came out, but today it falls behind.\n",
      "This version came with a flat 14% ABV on the label. It came in a lovely 16.9 ounce brown bottle. The entire contents of which now temporarily reside inside a clear glass liter mug. The tan head, resulting from the pour, did not last. Of course, it's black coffee brown. There's plenty to smell, as the nose gets hit with alcohol, tannins and roasted malt, pretty close to that order. The taste is more complex. There's a bit of the coffee and dark chocolate references that come from this style. But, the alcohol and tannins still dominate and that's disappointing for someone that doesn't appreciate a stout tasting like a shot of bourbon, even in this case, good bourbon. This doesn't taste badly, just below expectations. This was bottled in 2021, so it has had a decent chance to age. Yet, it tastes like it hasn't. There's no anticipated melding of the flavors to create good nuances. Disappointing doesn't mean bad, at least in this case. Nor does it mean exceptional, as this one is not. Lastly, there's no glass lacing, but the body is good.\n",

Although, with the exception of a few tasting notes and the alcohol content, I can't say that there has been much difference between the vintages. This is (and apparently always will be) a big, boozy, beer that is extremely sweet. I enjoy it immensely, but I do find that the syrupy sweetness becomes a little overpowering by the time I am finishing the beer. Basically, it is liquid candy for adults!!\n",

      "Smell - A huge plethora of aromas come to the nose immediately. Leather, molasses, bourbon, treacle, burnt brown sugar, with some fudge-y chocolate backing that up. Dark fruits like prunes and figs are also there. Vanilla is present throughout but subdued. The big thing is the sheer number of aromas and how well they play together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste - Bitter and boozy upfront with vanilla accenting everything before there is some molasses that trhen transitions to sweet slightly toasted brown sugar. Back to bitterness with roasted malts, some dark chocolate and molasses mixture before finishing with a soft toffee. Leather gets mixed in with the earthiness too. The booze is present but well disguised for a 29 proof beer. It drinks and the intensity of the booze is pretty akin to most other 11-12.5% imperial stouts, so there is a smoothness. Taste kind of fades away eventually but after a couple of sips the booziness lingers reminding you of the strength. The depth and variety of flavor here is impressive.\n",

Less carbonation than I expect and it drinks heavy, sweet, and a bit hot showing the booze a bit. I'm sort of getting the hang of and appreciating BBA stouts, but these 14%+ ones are on a different level that my palate has still not quite primed for. I'm sure it's a World-Class beer, but all I'm getting is a lot of bourbon, booze, and sweetness. It's good, big and a sipper. (Rating: 4.00)\n",

If F.W.B. had put \"collaboration with Buffalo Trace\" on the front of the box, these bottles would have been impossible to find. They would have immediately gone into collections. As it is, I'm very happy I was able to get my hands on a few of these, and they will be shared with my friends who are huge Buffalo Trace fans. This beer lives up to the hype you expect when the name Buffalo Trace is dropped. Smooth. Boozy. Packed with layers of flavor, just like the bourbons it's shared a home with. Store a few of these away with the wine. This is a collectors item.\n",

The first thing that struck me was that as this poured out of the bottle, it had a surprising amber hue with almost Dr. Pepper vibes. In the glass it's the super deep brown I expected, but with just a little bit of light coming in around the edges. Not much in the way of head, but given the ABV and age this came as no surprise.\n",

      "Pours milky yellow-orange like most Treehouse DIPAs. Smell is very similar to my memory of Haze - peaches and hops. Taste echoes the peach notes, but adds a good amount of bitterness. Unlike Orange Thing, which I tried yesterday, the bitterness here seems disconnected from the fruit flavors, whereas in Orange Thing it felt like a part of the whole \"orange\" experience.

The taste is just as great, a little more on the tart than sweet side, but a nice balance between the two. Orange pith, rich papaya, tart grapefruit all up front with a lingering bitterness that processes more sophistication than a typical.juice bomb. Mouthfeel is very soft and cushiony, with a moderate tartness that grows into the finish. I can see why this is rated so high, and I agree.\n",

      "\n",
      "T: Really nice fresh raspberries up front, followed quickly by a surprising bready/oak note. Quite tart and dry, it's almost like you ground up all the raspberry seeds and then sprinkled them among fresh, mashed raspberries.\n",

      "M: Very, very tart and sour right away. But after a couple sips to get acclimated, it settles in nice. It's really fruit-driven compared to other sours, and so you lose some of the funk and sour character.\n",
      "\n",
      "O: So this might be one of my most sought after beers of all time. Not sure why, but it is. I think it goes back to like early 2010s BA with the Top 250 list and this was always near the top. It was one of the first sours to gain a ton of notoriety. Once Jester King hit the Chicago market ca. 2015, I remember checking the shelves every time I went to Binny's to see if they got this in. All the bottles looked similar, but I could never spot the elusive Atrial Rubicite. Then lo and behold, Michigan sees a small drop late last year and I couldn't snatch it up quick enough! I'm sure this beer has been tweaked a bit over the years, but it still holds a Top 75 rating. I'll say, I'm not disappointed even though I'm late to the party. The raspberries are huge on this thing, but it's also got some complex vanilla, oak and woody notes to it once it sits for a bit. Just a wonderful beer that I'm super grateful to finally have after all these years.\n",

Beautiful ruby red in the glass with total clarity, although not much head at all to speak of. Looks like a fine red wine. Aromas are fresh crushed raspberry jam, fruit leather, cherry pie, pink lemonade, airheads candy, fruit chews, and a hint of wheat. Flavors lean very tart -- lemon juice, unripe raspberry, apple cider vinegar, salinity, drying oak astringency, and almost no sweetness at all. Feel is slippery and puckering.

      "citra and galaxy in this true east coast beauty, the only hill beer i managed to score while back east this time, but i found it on tap and liked it a lot. perhaps somewhat less exotic and with a bit lower of an overall wow factor than i was anticipating, but the quality cannot be denied, and neither can the fact that these two hops are awfully compatible, this is juicy and bold and sneaky strong, its big on flavor but its not super heavy to drink as these go, and the alcohol isnt really a factor for me, substantial but it still doesnt quite drink like a double. a little more color than expected actually, a dull rusty orange tint to it, not just a washed out yellow, hazy and dense looking but not messy, creamy white head of average height. the aroma is killer, i think the galaxy is in front of the citra, key lime, green melon, candied lemon, green tea, really fresh and bold, early onset too, hits right away, well supported by the citra, which is where i think citra does its best work, lemon curd, lemongrass, and a hint of white coconut, delicious and clean on top of a starchy earthy grain base that brings just a little bready richness and cereal sweetness to the mix. the flavor is like the nose, both hops rather robust and doing their thing, a little bit of green burn in the center but its only there for a flash and then its smoother, rounded out by a fresh grain profile and a little bit of residual sugar which does soften it. oily on the palate. definite lime and lime leaf to me, herbal with hints of sage and verbena, lemony too from the citra, really nicely designed, warms up well, has adequate carbonation, and really is low on the bitterness for being as hop forward as it is. light vanilla and honey later too, sexy in that way, fluffy feeling but not huge, smooth and wide and long. ill always be most jazzed on their saison and wild types, but this is real good.\n",

      "2024 Release - Nice deep brown color, great chocolate, leather, raisen and spice aroma. Definitely some heat from the cinnamon and peppers, but pretty balanced by the prominent barrel flavor which comes through nice as it warms. A bit thin and would prefer a little thicker feel, but overall a pretty darn good stout like most voodoo. Can see why this is highly rated.\n",
      "Had on tap. So excited to be able to try this, and simultaneously did and did not live up to the hype. Viscous black oil pour, no head save a thin brown ring. Bourbon, coconut, peppers, cinnamon, to a lesser degree cardamom, bake into the chocolate and vanilla base with maple in the nose. Taste does most the same but the bourbon and wood are thrown into the back seat, finishes chewy and drier. This is where the hype conversation comes in. Is it a great beer? Yes. Hype met, however is it better than other elite representations of this style? No, hype not met. Seen most in the feel where it has great spice, smooth malts and gooey adjuncts textures, but the barrel is not super assertive, want more mass but love the dry chewy nature.

Aged perfectly.\n",

      "S - floral, piney hops with a ton of sweet malt, cracker, some citrus (grapefruit),\n",

      "APPEARANCE: pours a cloudy, amber color with a beautiful two-finger, off-white head with excellent retention, the head eventually receded until a thin, unbroken layer of small bubbles remained throughout, medium carbonation and very heavy lacing on the glass, this is how beer is supposed to look.\n",

      "OVERALL: this is a terrific beer, it may be one of the best looking beers you can find, the taste is very pleasant but it's not especially complex, I see why this beer would be rated highly but it might be one of those beers that is overly hyped, having said that it's easily one of the best APA's I have had, I will definitely buy this again and would enthusiastically recommend to anyone who enjoys the style.\n",
      "Clear bright amber color with a very respectable white head with good retention and some nice lacing.\n",
      "The aroma is pale malt and citrus.\n",

      "The body is light/medium, moderate carbonation, smooth and very drinkable.\n",
      "Altogether, this is an outstanding pale ale, nice balance, very tasty and highly enjoyable. I wish this was more available locally.\n",
      "I'm not sure why I really do these beer reviews because I'm sure nobody reads them except myself on occasion, so it's sort of like a diary on beer. So when it comes to zombie dust, it's pretty much all been said before. Is this a 100, I have no idea why it is but it's close. Instead of describing the nuances of this beer I'm going to say one thing about it and that is the absolute pinpoint focus of the flavor. Not flabby nor multiple layers of hops but absolute concentrated monolithic and excruciatingly focused in character and flavor. For me that's what makes it so enjoyable an unusually impressive. Drink on.\n",
      "Poured (I know, sacrilege) chilled 45F into a 16oz pint glass.\n",
      "Appearance is deep gold with notable haze, true to the style. 1/4\" creamy white head that leaves a fair amount of lacing.\n",
      "Aroma is tropical fruit, resin and pine.\n",
      "Taste follows the nose with an immense punch of hoppy flavor to the palette. Grapefruit, dank resin and pine. Even a hint of tobacco on the backend. Nice crispness from the grain bill and the amount of carbonation which I would describe as medium carbonation. There is a bit of peppery hop bitterness that lingers...washes out any malty sweetness or lack thereof. I want to say this is balanced with sweet/bitter due to the mouth tackiness/stickiness, but I'm have a hard time finding sweetness beneath the enormous hop profile. But that's not a terrible thing as my rating reflects. This is a well-crafted beer that the brewer makes work. Body is slightly on the full side of medium.\n",
      "Overall, very tasty beer, true to the style, that was worth the money and I would buy again.\n",
      "Not as malty as Heady Topper. More modern NE IPA. The smell is out of this world. Fantastic. Currently my favourite.\n",
      "Nice IPA!\n",
      "Definitely my favorite beer, extremely tasty.\n",
      "Top notch IPA...IMHO better and more well rounded than Heady Topper. Lacks the juiciness of beers from Treehouse or Trillium, but has a resinous edge those brewers don't hit.\n",
      "Canned on 04/04/24. Poured a golden orange hue into a Samuel Smith imperial pint glass with a 2 finger creamy head that lingers for a little and leaves a descent amount of lacing. Nose is juicy with undertones of mango, passion fruit & pineapple; bready malts also present. Flavor is citrus and juicy but a bit rounder and not quite as bitter as a west coast; hop forward but much more tame finish (caramel sweetness). Moderate carbonation with a medium body & feel. A well crafted beer that lives up to the hype. Very, very enjoyable.\n",
      "Overrated.\n",
      "Review from 2018 on untappd: What a time to be alive. Finally getting to try this and I have much better shelfies available. Don't get me wrong. Good beer. Not great.\n",

      "Ha! What a review! Would love to revisit\n",
      "2019 (10th anniversary) vintage. Not the best stout I've had, by far, but certainly a fantastic brew. Highly recommend!\n",
      "I haven't tried many of this type of beer to make a fair comparison, but I can see why this has received so much love. Hole-a mole-a sauce this is tasty. Up front the bitter baker's chocolate is accented nicely by earthy vanilla, mild pepper, and faint spice. The chilli kicks up significantly heading into the finish, pretty much right into my heat sweet spot. Just a great beer that I am so glad to try, thanks beergoot!\n",
      "From a 500ml bottle, dated 03/11/23. Served in a spiegelau tulip glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pours a thin-appearing oak-brown with no obvious highlights. A generous finger of lush, coffee colored foam doesn’t last but maybe 20 seconds leaving a narrow collar and a rousable spatter of oily, super-slippery lacing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nose is… fruity? A sweet, candy-like coffee aroma and, totally unexpectedly, raspberry - which must be an olfactory hallucination, or at least how my brain is interpreting the combination of vanilla, cinnamon and chiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste is sweet but not heavily so, with a berry-like coffee bean flavour and that fruity mélange of cinnamon-vanilla-chile pepper that my brain persists in translating as ‘raspberry’ bringing a brightness and lightness which keeps the beer from tasting syrupy. A slick Cadbury-like milk chocolatey character becomes more evident as the beer warms accompanied by some heat from the chiles. There’s a very faint soy sauce quality in the aftertaste which doesn’t detract much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feel is oily-smooth and creamy-slick, medium bodied but a little light relative to the style with gentle, prickly carbonation. Chile heat builds up on the palate somewhat and amplifies the otherwise mild carbonation, lightening the mouthfeel further.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, pretty good but maybe a little bit of a mixed bag. I won’t call the flavours ‘muddled,’ but it is a very ‘busy’ flavour profile which, weirdly, for my palate, comes across very fruity and raspberry-like.\n",
      "2022 pint can, chilled, left to warm. Flat black on the pour, thick, sticky, tiny bit of struggled foam that vanished fast.\n",
      "Smells like cinnamon, vanilla, cacao nibs, and chilli peppers being muddled together.\n",
      "Tastes the same. Just too much going on. Cloyingly sweet and thick, slightly gritty, too much cinnamon, and who needs hot peppers in their stout?\n",
      "Overall, I’ve attended 5 Hunahpu’s Day celebrations at the CCB Spruce Street brewery over the years and have bought a bottle or can each time and come away thinking the same thing: nice novelty.,. but way too busy and quite over rated.\n",
      "2020 vintage received courtesy of @roguer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Appearance is typical for the style, which means it's a nice looking dark, dark brown with a half inch of tan colored head. Nice legs. Aroma is wonderfully rich and decadent, but not in an artificial way. Plenty of sweet molasses, chocolate, a hint of vanilla, and some faint figs / raisins. That description doesn't do this any real justice, so in summary, this beer smells great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste is interesting. Nowhere near as sweet on the nose, with some naturally bitter cacao notes, cinnamon and pepper combining brilliantly with the base beer. The spiciness is Goldilocks.....just right. A bit less and they wouldn't be notable. A bit more and they would overpower. There's a really nice sweetness deep into the finish that helps add to the complexity of this beer. Fully bodies and smooth, leaving a really nice coating on the tongue with a pleasant alcohol warming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall this is excellent.\n",
      "L - Hazy, opaque, creamy straw well with a creamy white head that dissipates somewhat slow, leaving a thin cap and a ton of lacing\n",
      "S - Fresh, piney, grassy hops right up front with some tropical fruit notes\n",
      "T - follows the nose - fresh, piney, grassy hops up front and throughout followed by tropical fruit notes - pineapple and a good amount of citrus - grapefruit and tangerine. Some floral notes as well\n",
      "F - medium, leaning on full bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth.\n",
      "O - Much more hop forward than Haze or Julius. Haze felt like the fullest, softest body with minimal hop bite and peach and passion fruit whereas Julius seemed to have a much stronger citrus kick with slight hops while still retaining a full body, whereas Green seems to have a thinner body while being much more hop forward and less of a juice bomb.\n",
      "6/23/24 On tap at the Charlton location. Finally made it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Server was great and helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pineapple and pink grapefruit flood the nose along with some pine and lactose aromas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perfectly sweet and bitter at the same time, what's not to love? Definite flavors of lemon rind, pineapple, and pine. Such an intense, fresh hop ending.\n",
      "May be biased as I consumed after drinking TH “haze”. I would rate this as a slightly better version of harpoon IPA. Flavor was solid but disappointing compared to the juice bombs TH has built their name on. I would say this aligns w/ the WCIPA flavor profile.\n",
      "Julius or Green as my TH favorite? Both are superb. Need to do some more work here.\n",
      "Canned 5/20\n",
      "\n",
      "I get a lot of citrus, more pithy than juicy, and some underripe nectarine and peach. There is an usually stiff bitterness for the style at the finish. Almost WCIPAish in nature. Good stuff.\n",
      "I had this beer at the main location in Charlton. First - I asked the server for a west coast IPA, and Green is clearly not that - but that is comment on the server, not the beer. I also like New England IPAs. My reason for the negative review is the beer was very, I'll say harsh on the tongue. It overwhelmed any appreciation for the taste that I may have had. I don't know if they got the carbonation wrong in that batch or what, but I got a distinct (and unpleasant) tingling feeling on my tongue. I dunno - I see this beer is highly rated. I've had a similar sensation from other IPAs from time to time - perhaps a particular hop causes my tongue to react that way, or maybe it was the particular batch? Or maybe I'm right and everyone else is wrong (LoL).\n",
      "Poured from the can into a Spiegeual IPA glass. Canned Dec 18th 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "Classic frothy and rich forming fine tall four to three finger big head. Small bubbles and cream white with a tellow like shine to the top and some island like retention. Pale orange solid body, with a hint of shine and maybe some yellow hues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Creamy sensing aroma. Mild touches of light herbs to pine and citrus oils with excellent hop forward presentation. Creamy hinting vanilla, maybe even some biscuity malt notes which make for a real good bakery dessert like quality. Quite nice nose here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Palate is really wonderful. Big hinting touches of cream vanilla mixing with herbal sage and some big touches of green earth. Supportive real rich malt backbone with an excellent young green hop angle but doesn't come out biting or painful. The finish is the most impressive thing, chewy pastry like sweet malt mixing touches of icing sugar, with building mint that gets menthol like hot in the perfect building intensity. Excellent malt surprising presentation that slow comes to fruition after some time also.\n",
      "\n",
      "Really well crafted IPA. Doesn't have a real distinct nose but it's flavor is first rate and world class.\n",
      "L - Hazy, opaque straw yellow with a creamy white head that sticks around a bit leaving behind a ton of lacing\n",
      "S - peach, pineapple, and papaya along with piney hops, juicy fruit gum\n",
      "T - follows the nose - peach, papaya, and pineapple juicy fruit intermixed well with relatively soft, piney hops, some floral notes, and a decent amount of malt to tie things together\n",
      "F - full bodied with moderate carbonation. Creamy and pillowy soft\n",
      "O - a truly great NEIPA. Treehouse really has this style nailed down\n",
      "16oz can from Sandwich location. Taste and smell is transcendent. Cannot believe how mellow this is on the palate considering the ABV. Incredible\n",
      "Have had this beer dozens of times throughout the years still delicious but nothing like the smaller batch brews from MONSON i really miss those days\n",
      "At first glance this beer doesn’t appear that it is going to be decent let alone, good. Off yellow with almost a hint of green this extra hazy ipa lives up to the name. The nose is the first indication that something is a miss here. Tropical fruits orange and peach shine through a subtle floral scent. We all drink beef for the taste and this one delivers. Again the citrus tropical lead the way and give way to a slight bitter hop. A smooth mouthfeel makes this an easy drinker that can be enjoyed beyond its ABV.\n",
      "Surely this rocked the boat when it was first released ten years ago, but being widely available in 2024, coupled with every brewery in the country trying their hand at NE haze, it would appear some of the luster has faded.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's bullshit. This is delicious. Thick, creamy, opaque juice with heavy lacing and just enough flavor to get your fix without drinking puree.\n",
      "\n",
      "Glad to finally get the chance to try it. It won't be the last time.\n",
      "Beautiful golden Haze with a nice white foam on top\n",
      "\n",
      "The nose is a bit on mute but still some fruits\n",
      "\n",
      "The taste is great with a nice fruit punch and light bitterness that balance the slight sweetness\n",
      "\n",
      "The mouthfeel IS very nice, velvety and not overly carbonated\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall a great NEIPA even if I'd love to try it fresher (canned on 11.06.23)\n",
      "IMHO this is a better beer than Julious and Green as well as their \"very\" cousins and should be in the top ten NEIPA. Such a perfect balance of taste and feel.\n",
      "Pretty freaking decent. Probably fantastic on draft. Bit of a harsh aftertaste\n",
      "750ml bottle, 2021 release, poured into a stemless wine glass. Enjoyed on 05.04.2024, reviewed from Tasting Journal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The beer pours a nice salmon pink color, amber and ruby hues, nice clarity with a fizzy off-white head, no retention nor lacing. The aroma is nice, tart cherry, oak, citrus, vanilla, quite floral, soft grain, lots of funk, and mineral water. The flavors are great, funky oak, bright cherry juice, vinous grape, citrus, wildflower, berry fruits, vanilla, and mineral water. The mouthfeel is good, coating, crisp, tart and tangy with a lighter medium body, lively dry finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Verdict: A really nice \"kriek\" style wild from The Lost Abbey. The cherry is the star and is expressed very well. Bright, delicate, tart, great depth to the cherry with nice barrel character.\n",
      "OG. Murky pale red appearance with loose bubbly light light pink fast fleeting head. Nose and palate is bold and jammy cherry, cherry skin, slight funk, oak, and tastefully tart. Moderate body and carbonation, creamy mouthfeel. Held up amazingly well.\n",

      "\n",
      "Review 2100! For this next landmark review I got my hands on the seemingly rare yet highly rated Cable Car Kriek. I haven't had anything from Lost Abbey in quite some time either (exactly 1000 reviews ago apparently), so I'm excited to try this legendary Kriek. Let's pop it open and find out what it's all about\n",
      "\n",
      "Pours a cloudy reddish orange with just a few pinkish white bubbles that quickly fade to nothing and obviously leaves no lacing\n",
      "\n",
      "It's so fruit forward and tart in the nose. Not too much funk but that's fine by me. I'm picking up on aromas of sour cherry, apple cider vinegar, sharp oak, lemon zest, crackery malt, jammy blackberry, lime zest, and light red wine\n",
      "\n",
      "In taste it's much brighter and I'm all about it. A bit more funk is present here but still nothing crazy. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting sour cherry, cherry pit, lemon juice, crackery malt, almond, lime zest, brown sugar, sharp oak, apple skin, and light leather. The swallow brings notes of sour cherry, dry oak, jammy blackberry, lemon juice, tannic red wine, crackery malt, almond, and light brown sugar\n",
      "\n",
      "A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp beer. Finishes bone dry and refreshing\n",
      "\n",
      "This one is awesome. Absolutely worth seeking out if you like Krieks\n",
      "2021 vintage. Ruby red body with surprisingly little carbonation and no head whatsoever. Aromas are pretty standard kriek: cherry pie, lemon, hay, bit of vinegar. Very little funk, which is a bit unusual. Flavors are acetic but also semi-sweet, with predominant notes of cherry and apple cider vinegar. Feel is slippery and a bit flat due to the low carbonation. Overall I think this is one of those beers that made waves upon release when the idea of Belgian lambics was still relatively unknown in the US, but now that we have broader access to some of the best Belgium offerings here in the states it doesn't quite hold up. Especially given the price point ($90/750ml), I would not buy this again but happy to have the opportunity.\n",

      "The nose is still distinctly Cable Car, with noticeable yet restrained funk and lemony citrus. The cherry adds more brightness and is a fresh, fruity addition. With time, a lot of oak and Brett comes to the forefront.\n",
      "\n",
      "The palate is sour and noticeably acidic, with a surprisingly low carbonation. Was definitely hoping for more of it to cut that tart cherry and acid, but overall it’s never overwhelming. The tannin from the cherry works really well with the overall profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "As stated above, not sure if that much carb was lost since 2021 or it was just never very high, but I felt it needed more. That said, it drinks bright and refreshing, with restrained tannin.\n",

      "Appearance – The beer pours a super hazy orange-yellow color with a thick head of off-white foam. The head has a fantastic level of retention, fading slowly over time and leaving tons of streaky lace on the sides of the glass.\n",
      "Smell – The aroma is heaviest of an orange juice and tropical fruit smell of papaya, mango, and pineapple. Along with these smells is lots of guava and tangerine, along with some herbal hops and a nice showing of grapefruit and pine. Other notes of a bready and doughy smell as well as some tropical fruit candy and some peach and apricot.\n",
      "Taste – The taste begins with a bready and doughy malt flavor paired with lots of the tropical flavors that were in the nose. There is a big showing of papaya, guava, and tangerine, along with some pineapple and orange juice. There is a bit of a pine and herbal hop upfront, with a decent showing of grapefruit. As the taste advances the pine and herb get stronger, while the grapefruit fades a tad. Some peach and apricot, replace a bit of the tropical fruits, with some notes of earth and dirt joining in as well. There is a touch of pepper and spice, and a hint of booze and wood that come on at the end, leaving one with a rich and juicy taste to linger on the tongue.\n",
      "Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is quite thick and chewy with a carbonation level that is slightly lower. For the rich and big flavors of the brew, the feel is excellent, coating the tongue in all the big flavors of the brew.\n",
      "Overall – A quite nice hazy indeed. This ranks up there with the other big scorers for tree house and is certainly one to try.\n",
      "From a can dated 3/13/24. Wow! A fabulous NEDIPA from Tree House. The aroma of tropical fruit and dankness was deliciously powerful. Maybe just a tad overly bitter on the finish, but one the best I’ve had from Tree House.\n",

      "Aromatics burst from the glass with huge citrus, mango and tropical notes; some cantaloupe musk and a sweaty dankness with herbal green undertones.\n",
      "Taste is sweet with ripe pineapple, over ripe orange, grapefruit and a green dank and sweaty herbal flavour - moderate resinous bitterness that compliments the fruity flavours.\n",
      "Solid medium mouthfeel with very decent carbonation and a bittersweetness that sits briefly at the finish.\n",

      "\n",
      "Pours murky gold with a half-inch head of white. Moderate retention and lacing. Dank and citrusy in the nose. White grapes, lemon-lime, unripe peach. Medium bodied with a soft mouthfeel. Pine, unripe pineapple, white peaches on the palate. Finishes with a touch of malt and a balancing bitterness.\n",
      "Poured a golden body with minimal head and minor lace patches. Aroma has notes that range from tropical fruits to mild and earthy hops. Medium, fuller body, balances a slight dankness with earthy, dry hops that are low-key bitter and there's a full tropical fruit sweetness (almost like fruit punch there are so many flavors), but not too sweet and a touch of bitterness on clean finish helps beer and this is easily a beer I'd recommend.\n",
      "Pale, opaque orange with thin tan head. Standard hazy look. Smell is complex with pithy rind, orange, vanilla, and malts. Similar smell to some of the Hill Farmstead IPAs. Extremely bright taste with tons of tropical, sweet notes however has a nice bitterness at the end. Pleasing feel that doesn't linger too long. Swish is a spectacular hazy that stands uniquely in a sea of copy cats.\n",
      "Bissell Brothers is the Larry Bird/Magic Johnson of breweries to me. Not a knock at all, but my MJ is the Alchemist. That being said, the Swish drops in to my stomach like a Steph Curry logo 3 point shot. Nothing but net, all swish. Beautiful Laker gold color. Completely opaque with a slight bubbly froth. On the nose you get Phoenix Suns orange with some Miami Heat tropical pineapple notes. Was expecting a thick Shaq like body but it’s a more lean medium body, reminiscent of a Dwight Howard. Taste wise you get the traditional IPA bitter hop bite that gives a slight Celtics green herby taste. However it also has that new wave NEIPA melon, cream, citrus fruit flavor. The NEIPA is the new dynasty, the Golden State Warriors of the beer industry. What an absolute treat, go Nuggets.\n",

Resin certainly leads the way, followed by brighter pine, flowers, mild dankness, and a blend of fruity hops that lean slightly tropical. Malt presents notes of honey, toast, and white bread.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flavor follows remarkably close to the nose. Alcohol bite is impossible to ignore, but it's not so aggressive as to turn the sip unpleasant. While I mentioned that this one is a touch syrupy, there's plenty of liveliness on the palate, regardless. You're still obviously drinking an IPA, not a barleywine or stout; it just happens to be a double-digit ABV IPA. Tasting notes include orange marmalade, resin, honey, white bread, and a melange of tropical fruit, citrus, and berries. Wonderfully bitter.\n",
      "\n",
      "As much credit as I give this beer for staying true to concept, it's also impossible to ignore that in many ways the brewing world has caught up to, if not Hill Farmstead, at least their take on this style of beer. I wonder if I could tell much difference between this beer and SN Hoptimum (probably the closest (II)IPA parallel in terms of both flavor profile and mouthfeel). It's an excellent beer, outstanding really, and perhaps 10 years ago it would have blown my mind - but today, it'll have to settle for \"impressive.\"\n",

Smell features big peach and orange with various oaks, mild barnyard funk, yogurt, and pretty strong barrel funk. Taste is more oaky, add lemon to the fruits from the nose, funk is much more subdued, but still has the drying effect on the finish.

      "A: Cradled discharge to the carafe, which precedes the conveyed ounces to the stoneware without disturbing the residuals. This is a continuous draw to isolate the sediment, for resettling & repurposing thereafter. In this case, a concealed coloration to the ceramic, if not allowing an aerial perspective. Correspondingly, the isolated carafe is not clay built, and is more accepting to the environmental auras. This is shown through a shade near tiger lilies, while the later transfers decant with a tinged (sweet potato) hue. All the while, radiation impacts that aerial perspective on the isolated – porcelain – ounces, which has a California poppy tone, before decanting a late shade towards sun conures. There are cloudy inceptions that are relaxed over time, as longevity obstacles an interlaced lucidity. On the other hand, a white hibiscus collar tops at around/< .3 dm, which is shortly combatted through stunted PH levels, departed lupulin effects, and impacted ions. Accordingly, the retreat is advanced to thin seclusions, from a micro- to a nanometer level, of thickness. The output here has a dogwood flower tinge, which is eventually dispersed & canceled out. With this in mind, there is an insignificant preservation on fretwork, unless controlling the disturbance(s) upon the turns & discharges\n",

      "S: An intricately involved webbing through the fermentable behaviors, while an oak ridden subtext materializes. The amylase conversions on alpha and beta are necessitated over time, as an incandescence exploitation develops over the clay pot lays, which softens the sheltered acidity to nuance the trails. Respectively, the kickoff is soft to pencil in phenylethyl acetates, which render fresh-cut peonies & agave nectars. Such aspects sit beneath isoamyl octanoates, when detailing peaches aside rangpurs with bergamot oranges on a higher floor. A voyage that draws in a resemblance to apple cobblers & apricot compotes at the midriff, while an oak lactone sentiment grows underneath. Appropriately, a wooded stave to plank presence with a rustic rurality in the forward climbs, just as Brettanomyces mount in volumes. This is conveyed through decanted intervals upon tepid breezes, as clocked degrees attend the aged corrosion(s) accordingly. To that extent, there is an isovaleric acid denotation to cultured cheeses, which has an elderly hop brink. Nonetheless, the main drivers place an emphasis on phenolic compounds, as time > 4 hrs.

A facet that stays below to not overdo, or outperform, as the intention is there to supplement the bacterial densities. The notations have a lactic ignition that eventually eases over time, providing a bready grain bill that speaks to towering silos. Sequentially, a development that finds a recording near raw cranberry honey, while connoting decayed positions across morello cherries, lemons, and citrus. There is a eugenol to hexanoate compartmentalization towards the wort complications, when implying cloves apart anise, which steers an infectious benefactor upon the lipids of oak. Suitably, a 4-EP specification on rabbity phenols, which have a catacomb audacity through pholcidaes. The process is enamored across the balmy increments @ an hour > 6, for an evaporated nuance that neighbors Grüner Veltliner, before reaching (cellar-controlled) Oloroso VORS @ an hour > 18. Accordingly, damp growths ratify grapefruit, while an oxidized nuttiness grows amid buckskin & nicotiana\n",

      "M: A refermented element on cellared acerbity that provides a calm softness to the effusions, while the fermentable derivatives cleanly manipulate. A vintage that has regulated the presence on sulfur dioxides to gunpowder, beyond the presetting notions most akin to sea shells. Thus, an approach that has an attenuated calmness on the weathered cessations, when maintaining a smooth to caustic balance\n",

      "O: An involved development that’s facilitated over basket suspension, where the later ounces are subjected to the retreated residues. Thereby, driving an indigenous difficulty to wild microorganisms, while being careful to not containment the overall build. Outside of this, the methodology comes with a vintaged maturity, for reimagining the ester offshoots\n",
      "Pours golden with frothy soap off white head. Mustyness and wash rind cheese with a touch of apple flesh on the nose. The first thing that stands out is that this is soft - it doesn't have any commandeering characteristics that detract from the others. I get some apple, some arugula bitterness, with restrained acidity. Maybe some musty sour cherry too, kinda like what you get in a kriek but very much more subtle. This is an excellent excellent spon beer. One of the best beers of this variety I've had in some time.\n",

Its vibrant, fresh cut hay and oak alongside some citrus wedges like you just stomped some kids at youth soccer. One of the best expressions of brett ever in a beer. Sawft body too, never felt too acidic or sour. This is honestly better than most Belgian gueuzes. I realize given the demographics of beer nerds, they're going to keep fetishizing Western Europe, but I'll be more than happy to take any of these Wisconsin and Oregon gems off your hands.\n",

      "No.6 brought notes of lemon zest, oak, and white grape must on a sweet, musty backbone. No. 7 came on sweeter, with more of a citrus candy quality and a bit less Brett character. The oak component had more of a \"freshly cut\" aroma to it, and preceded notes of bleu cheese that I didn't get on No.6. No.8 was probably the most distinctly unique; white wine like with 7, but more of a grapefruit-specific citrus quality and a deeper complexity of wet hay and an overall better balance of sweet & funky.\n",
      "\n",
      "The palate on all three of these were led predominantly with drying tannin and bitter citrus peel. The oakiness was relatively similar amongst the three and bolstered the flavor influence from the yeast bill, however while No.8 showed its youth with the least amount of bitterness, 7 & 8 had comparable dryness and a more noticeable citrusy bitterness. No. 6 was also had the highest level of residual puckering tartness.\n",

      "Overall, I'm honestly surprised with how similar each vintage of these beers was. Each had their own unique nuances, but when broken down you could find very similar characteristics on both the nose and the palate with both, characterizing a predominance of fresh oak, Brett, bitter citrus, drying tannin, and a noticeable albeit subtle funky/cheesy quality on the backbone. Definitely fun to have these all side-by-side.\n",

      "T: Follows the nose with a strong opening of dark chocolate, brownie batter, bourbon barrel, and roasted malts. Hints of espresso. Dark fruit (raisins?) that meshes well with caramel, vanilla, and coconut. Oak and slight char are detectable towards the finish.\n",

      "On tap at Frisco Taphouse in Crofton, MD. Definitely lives up to expectations - pours pitch black with a tan head, huge aromas and flavors of dark roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, bourbon, vanilla, and some coconut. Rich and sumptuous mouthfeel. Stellar.\n",
      "It's incredibly rich and decadent....it's delicious....perhaps the thickest creamiest beer I've ever had... the bourbon is quite evident, as it should be... the coconut wafts in and out like a ghost....incredibly intense experience....having this on Black Friday morning while cooking a breakfast casserole... warming to the belly after a few healthy sips...this is a real banger.\n",

      "\n",
      "Overall- The appearance was amber brown as promised with below average head retention and lacing. The bouquet was a pleasant Pinot Noir, cherry, oak and brett. My only complaint with the nose was the strength. Flavors were a very nice blend of Pinot Noir, cherry, oak and brett. Feel was great with medium body, highly dry finish, moderate acidity and gentle abundant carbonation. Overall this was a highly complex beer that delivered a delightful drinking experience. Normally this is not a style that I tend to gravitate toward, but I will definitely drink this beer again if I see it.\n",
      "August ‘23. A fresh bottle.\n",
      "L: Ruby, reddish orange, thin head.\n",
      "S: Rich cherry, vanilla, strawberry, hints of spices and oak, alcohol.\n",
      "T: Tart joyful fruity spices. Tart cherry and apple upfront backed with cinnamon. Spices through the body, mainly cinnamon. Faint malty caramel. More sweetness in the body. Hints of berry. Notes of oak, mineral, and funk on the finish.\n",
      "F: Tart, faintly prickly, dry finish.\n",
      "O: Late summer, in a bottle. Fall and the harvest are faintly on the air. That’s what this is. The spice, the fruit, what a beer.\n",

      "Palate – 4.5 – Medium; watery; lively but soft carbonation.\n",
      "Final impression and summation: 4.5 Another excellent brew from RR. Their combo of pediococcus, lactobacillus, brettanomyces and saccharomyces species yields a great tasting mixture of organic acids and other metabolic end products although as the temperature rises, the tannin begins to dominate. Still, quite good!\n",
      "375mL cork-topped bottle, bottled on 020823 (barrel aged 9 to 15 months, pinor noir barrels, with cherries). Served in my new stemless CBC glass. Brillian ruby color with excellent clarity and little head formation. Mild aroma suggests a bit of tartness. Flavor brings on a LOT of that tartness, approaching outright sour, but has a delicious ripe cherry flavor which complements the Brett nicely. Sharp carbonation is suitable here.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I was more into sours I might find this outstanding. I find it more drinkable than Cerise Cassée, and I really appreciate the balance here. Unfortunately for me it's a balance between sour Brett and sweet cherries, not so much the oak and the brown ale underneath that I'd be more interested in.\n",
      "This pours out copper, a bit of haze, minimal head and no lacing. Nose is a punchy vinegar note, wine barrel and fruit beneath. Flavor is a less aggressive presentation of the nose, with cherry and full red wine elements melding into the strong acidity. The wildness also comes through as a counter to the acidity, putting some earthiness and funk on the back end. Well built and delicious.\n",
      "I've had SoS many times, and in fact at this year's Vermont Brewers Festival I recognized Sean Lawson just from his caricature on each can. I was surprised to find I haven't rated it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pours a nice amber-gold in the glass, with just a touch of haze. Smell is piney citrus with some floral hints. That sounds like any of 100 IPAs, but SoS has a really inviting smell.\n",
      "On the palate the first thing that hits is the bitterness and that lingers on the swallow, but between those points you get some malty sweetness and lots of fruit notes. It drinks like a regular IPA - the 8% doesn't show in the taste, only in adding a bit of body to the mouthfeel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vermont IPA (and DIPA) really deserve to be their own style(s). This has way more in common with Alchemist and Fiddlehead IPAs than the NEIPAs it's often lumped together with.\n",
      "Super dialed. Drink as cold as possible.\n",
      "I’ve had Lawson’s Little Sip of Sunshine before, it’s good but wow this beer is incredibly smooth for a DIPA, dangerously smooth. You would never know it’s 8 ABV. Some bitterness, some fruitiness, very balanced. Definitely worth a try.\n",
      "Hazy deep gold, minimal head..smells good, tastes absolutely fantastic! Maybe the best DIPA I’ve ever had. I don’t know why I haven’t purchased this one more often..That will change from now on. Cheers!\n",
      "Pours a brassy color, clear off white puffy head, ok retention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nose is so bright and vibrant; it’s like the can says, “tropical vacation,” but it’s clean and refreshing tropical; as if those tropical fruits had a pine like brightness, there is a little sweetness to it too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste is a moderate dose of maltiness; the tropical notes are back but cut deeply by resin and pine like quality in the hops; the do not fight one another but balance one another out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medium in body, but definitely towards the higher end, biting and tingly bitterness on a quite clean finishing beer, there is a light warming from abv but the drinkability wins out; dangerously drinkable beer.\n",
      "This beer certainly doesn't need my review as it's a modern classic with WC heritage more than anything. The beauty is in the perfect balance of feel, savory pine resin, coppery looks, and non conformist execution. The flagship in a fleet of solid brews for Lawson's Finest\n",
      "This beer is my go to beer when i cannot get to the River Roost Brewery in White River Junction for their offerings. I like the smooth fresh taste and no after bitter.\n",
      "Tastes like an IPA. Citrus, a little pine, slightly herbaceous, very bitter but still quite drinkable. Can't really complain, but, am I missing something? What exactly makes this the best stuff ever?\n",
      "A: At home, poured 1 pint can into chilled glass. Full inch of foam, head retension 2+ minutes. Medium amber with slight haze. Good inch of sparse thin lacing that stayed on glass sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "S: Smell has some citra with lemon. Hop has a piney taste with some other citrus flavoris.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Awesome initial bitterness that meshes with the hops. Not too sweet and very enjoyable. Residual bitterness followed by slight warmth of alcohol. Malt had nothing indicated by smell. But the malt almost gave me a hint of honey with a medium body slightly sweet finish. Very mild which balanced well with the carbonation.\n",
      "\n",
      "M: Medium body that was not to crisp allowing for a more full carbonation, hop, alcohol balance without being too heavy. Also not too sugary or creamy at all. What it should be. Very enjoyable. I wish I was in VT. No tartness or acidity present. Everything was well integrated.\n",
      "\n",
      "O: This was a great option from the can. Enjoyed the flavor development as it warmed up in a glass. I would get this again and happy to have cans local.\n",
      "This is a very good IPA that rivals Russian River Brewery IPA's. Circulation is a challenge, most stores in Northern CA do not carry it, urgh.\n",
      "Pours an effervescent gold/honey with a thumb eggshell colored head. Good head retention & lacing\n",

      "S: Bready, piney, lemons, mangoes. Pineapple shows up as this beer warms\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Follows the nose, dryness, pineapple & grapefruit up front. Grapefruit, limes, a hint of pine & dryness/breadyness once this beer is warm. Finishes a touch cakey with pineapple, grapefruit & a kiss of green melon\n",
      "\n",
      "MF: Medium body, moderate carbonation, nice balance\n",
      "\n",
      "Classic West Coast DIPA, in your face, but very drinkable to the point of too easy. This would so be in my rotation if feasible\n",
      "Pours a cloudy golden straw with a finger of foamy head that slowly dissipates to a thin ring with some lacing. Aroma of pineapple, mango, grapefruit and trace of pine. Taste follows nose.\n",
      "The first Citra was incredible. We found that bottle aging for ten days smoothed it out.\n",
      "After a few years of substandard Citra hops resulting in a brew not as good as the first, it's back up to where it was in the beginning.\n",

      "Citra pours a slightly hazy, cloudy amber color with a big beautiful head. A sixteen ounce, canned 11/24/22 is very strong with the Citra aroma. Taste is powerful and good. Citra and Amarillo go together well in this brew. Fabulously smooth and not really bitter at all. Overall a fine Double IPA.\n",

      "\n",
      "Flavour isn't quite as rich as the aroma, but it presents all the goodies. Bitter citrus and pine, some caramel malts, some round fruits... finish is bitter but not overpowering by any means. It's mostly in the pith/citrus side of things, but not the full on acid bomb of like a Monkish, and it's balanced with a little bit of earthy pine and a touch of the sweet malts to balance.\n",
      "\n",

      "Big straw/lemon gold hazy with 1/2 inch creamy white head. Dissolves pretty quickly with decent residual lacing. Somewhat subdued nose but a complex mash up of straw, grass, lemon, lime, dank integrating with grapefruit comes out as beer loses initial chill. Taste is more prominent grapefruit and dank though juicy melon, malty biscuit, citrus also show off. Body is a nicely smooth medium malty body accompanied by a refreshing bright carbonation. Considering 10% and content weight…surprisingly refreshing.\n",

      "Straw yellow body with some a bit of warm yellow orange if the light hits it right. White frothy head with nice sticky lacing down the sides. Nose is dank and boozy - grass, grapefruit oil, dried mango. Taste is bitter and boozy up front and then moves to the fruity mango, with very warm booziness at the end. Warm pineapple juice type sweetness, hoppy, thick and slick from the booze, this is not an everyday beer - but I don't think it's trying to be. What it is, though, is delicious and bold.\n",
      "2023 Anniversary Version - Really good IPA - nice hope mix - excellent balance - next to no booziness for 10% (as is OH's way) - creamy with plenty of citrus backing - very solid.\n",

      "I was surprised to see that Trillium did a Xmas drop in the Chicagoland area of fresh hazy beers, so I grabbed some as soon as I could for my holiday week. I find that when someone can do a lower abv (6.6%) with a lot of flavor that that is more an achievement than knocking out a DIPA. My pallet generally goes toward liking the higher abvs, but I need the lower one once in awhile when having more than one beer in a sitting. I am loving the balance in bitterness here more than anything. The Midwest brewers love to land on the sweeter side, but I actually like the dryer bitter finishes more. The beer does lack quite a bit on the nose as I am not getting much beyond some citrusy hop notes buried deep. The feel is full and smooth. Overall a great beer. I wish I had a fresh Zombie Dust to compare to see which would win for me.\n",

      "\n",
      "The aroma was outstanding. Toasted marshmallow came through big time. Loads of fragrant vanilla as well. There was a nice milk chocolate presence too. Hint of graham cracker and kiss of boozy barrel. The barrel was a bit more subtle than I anticipated however. Quite sweet overall, though appropriately so given the style.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flavor profile was nearly as impressive as the aroma and boozier. Again, marshmallow and vanilla came through super strong. Nice caramel and roasted malt base up front. Boozy bourbon notes appeared from the get go and intensified as the beer moved along the palate. Good dose of milk chocolate in the center. The beer was definitely sweet but not excessively so. More boozy bourbon barrel character on the back end and the finish. A pleasant alcohol warmth lingered after the swallow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent rich, full bodied mouthfeel. Perhaps a touch thinner than I anticipated however. Oily and slick on the palate. The liquid contained a fine, mellow effervescence that worked nicely for the style.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bourbon Barrel-Aged Rocky Road literally smelled like liquefied, booze-soaked s’mores, and it tasted pretty similar as well. Angry Chair Brewing are known for producing some of the best pastry stouts in the world, and this one did not disappoint.\n",
      "2022 vintage; consumed on 1/20/2024\n",
      "\n",
      "Pours a viscous, midnight-black body capped with just shy of a finger of dark khaki-hued foam; decent head retention leaves a slight layer of cap, lasting, frothy collar, and no lacing holding to the walls of the glass with any longevity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aromas of gooey marshmallow waft into fruity rye spice as a walnut underscore embraces bourbon vanillins against a milk chocolate build and barrel char lingering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste brings cocoa resounding upfront, with bourbon vanilla interludes meeting a peak of chocolate-covered walnuts through the mid-palate while barrel char and darker cocoa residuals mark the back end of the profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mouthfeel shows a medium-full body and a lower froth of carbonation, yielding a thick, malted slickness over the mid-palate as a prickly warmth and wispy char cuts through a modest yet overarching stickiness into the back end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Minimal barrel yet true-to-form, the Rocky Road inspiration comes through in spades; an honest mock dessert à la sweet stout in typical Angry Chair fashion: comfortingly one-dimensional.\n",

      "Batch date 10/10/22; strong hit of acidic sour up front that transitions to a nice ripe juicy peach finish. Very delicious beer and glad I secured a bottle to try.\n",
      "Just starting off by saying this beer is just stupid good, now that I have that out the way I'll continue with more detail. The pour of the beer isn't anything overly special, typical golden orange color, rapidly fading white head. The smell of the beer has that fruity Casey-like funk going on which is expected. The taste is honestly one of the best tasting peach sours I've had. I was truly blown away by the sweet yet tart peach flavor they were able to get out of this, incredible! The feel is medium bodied, finished dry and tart. Overall just outstanding!\n",

      "\n",
      "Formidable, but plenty drinkable; dangerous! Probably as good as take on the style as I can remember\n",
      "Amber orange body has a light to moderate haze; head is fluffy white and sticky enough to provide lacing streaks. Aromas of hop citrus - tangerine and grapefruit come with a side of pine needles. A moderate sweetness on the nose translates to the opening of the taste, giving the lightly toasted malt a raw honey edge. It doesn’t take long for the candied orange to turn pithy. There’s a ring grapefruit and passion fruit note to keep things from jumping off the bitter edge. But thankfully, there is a slow decent into herbal, piney, and slightly earthy bitterness.\n",
      "On tap, pours a clear light copper. Smell of citrus and resin hits from a couple of feet away. Taste follows, with a big resinous flavor that is surprisingly light and drinkable, especially at the ABV. Fantastic beer.\n",

      "Feel - medium in body and carbonation, hoppy resinous sticky finish\n",
      "Overall - Finally got hold of this gem on a beer haul from Vermont and it's just as great as I thought it would be. Like Sip and Double, the smell really pops right from the can and continues after the pour. No trouble picking up the dank tropical and herbal scent. Triple kicks off with spicy dank hops followed by ripe pineapple and grapefruit pith that ends with that wonderful resinous sticky finish. This is a bold brew that lives up to the hype so there is no other choice than to pair it with Sunshine of Your Love by Cream. I’ve been waiting so long, To be where I’m going, In the sunshine of your love!\n",
      "Draft at brewery. Golden pour, soft white head. Light fruity aroma with a hit of strength. Taste is sweet, fruity and warm. Smooth as a baby's bottom. Light toffee notes, orange. Another wow!\n",
      "3/27/24 Batch! Sweet tropical hoppy, slightly malty, and an orange juicy, citrus-dank nose on this one! Taste follows with a soft and creamy, orange juice citrus hoppy bitter finish. Wonderfully balanced and hides the big ABV really well! As it warms, however, a gin-like, citrus booziness starts to peek out just a touch. Outstanding!\n",

      "The beer poured a thinner bodied, dark chestnut brown hue that approached black. An inch-tall, foamy, tan colored crown topped the liquid and slowly fell to a thick, frothy cap and a dense, bubbly collar. Spotty lacing blanketed the glass after every sip.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aroma was solid but not remarkable. Coffee notes came through strongest. Dark roast coffee specifically. Roasted malts were also apparent. Loads of cinnamon too. There was a subtle, sweet maple-like quality as well. Hint of vanilla. The maple intensified as the beer warmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flavor profile was also very roast forward. Roasted malts led things off up front. Dark roast coffee was also quite apparent. Sweet maple notes came through in the center. Cinnamon was noticeable here as well. More deep roast on the back end and in the finish. Some bitter char lingered after the swallow.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mouthfeel was super creamy and frothy but quite thin. The liquid contained an ultra fine, zippy, tongue blanketing effervescence that gave the beer a nice suppleness on the palate.\n",

      "Five years ago, I might have really enjoyed this beer, but my current palate found it far too roasty and bitter for my liking. Additionally, as much as I tried to appreciate it for being an imperial porter, I could not get past wanting it to be a full-bodied imperial stout.\n",

      "Taste: The flavor is bold and intense, with a strong coffee profile and a noticeable alcohol warmth. The dark chocolate and vanilla flavors are present as well, with a slight sweetness that balances the bitterness from the coffee. There is a slight smokiness in the aftertaste that lingers on the palate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is silky smooth, with a creamy texture that coats the tongue. The beer is medium-bodied and has a medium carbonation level, making it easy to drink.\n",

      "Overall Impressions: Kane Brewing Sunday Brunch is a complex and flavorful beer that is perfect for sipping on a lazy Sunday morning. The coffee, chocolate, and vanilla flavors combine perfectly to create a decadent and satisfying experience. The alcohol warmth is noticeable but not overpowering, making it a great choice for those who enjoy a bit of a kick with their morning coffee. The smoky finish is a nice touch, adding an unexpected depth to the flavor profile. Overall, this is a top-notch imperial porter that is well worth trying.\n",
      "Deep, dark black. Head was not as dark as I guessed it would be, more of an off white color. Strangely the nose is cinnamon at first, but after first taste then the nose was more coffee. Taste was cinnamon coffee with a smooth finish. Not bitter, all smooth!! Great Porter.\n",

      "2021 vintage bottle share at a bottle share on 12/3/22. Amazing beer; drank fairly easily and just a ton of flavour and barrel in the taste. It was a little on the boozy side, not terrible, but I'd expect that from a 21% ABV beer.\n",

Well, I’m on vacation this week and today turned out to be a stormy day, so I figured it’s the perfect time to crack this beer I received in a BIF from the legendary @Eziel. I’m getting close to the end of what he sent me, and they’re all heavy hitters. Let’s see what this one is all about\n",

      "\n",
      "There’s a definite sweetness in the nose, but it’s wonderfully balanced given its size. I’m picking up on aromas of chocolate fudge, earthy bourbon, toasted oak, nougat, black cherry, sweet caramel, molasses, toasted hazelnut, and light vanilla\n",
      "\n",
      "This one really packs a punch in taste, heavy booze and char fight for attention while a huge sweetness backs it all up. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting charred oak, cacao, sweet bourbon, red grape, marshmallow, sweet vanilla, molasses, toffee, light nutty malt, and black cherry. The swallow brings notes of hot bourbon, charred oak, nougat, cacao, black cherry, molasses, apple brandy, vanilla, sweet caramel, and nougat\n",

      "This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and no lacing.\n",

      "\n",
      "This is a nice bridge between some of overtly wine based Black Tuesday variants, and the regular bourbon Black Tuesday. The grape brandy adds a pleasantly oaky vinous character, sweet, but finishes dry, with oaky char, marshmallow, dark chocolate, caramel, roast, and bourbon.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is medium bodied, slightly thin as most Black Tuesday variants tend to be, with a lots of concentrated booziness. It’s not overwhelmingly boozy, but it really kind of does drink like a distilled stout liqueur.\n",

      "750 ml wax capped bottle, 2021 edition (aged in Copper & Kings grape brandy barrels for a year, then aged an additional year in bourbon barrels), 21.8% ABV, bottled 01/19/21. Served in a Black Tuesday chalice, the beer pours dark brown/black with not quite an inch tan head that fizzled away somewhat quickly. I like the aroma a lot, the brew smells like dark fruit, brandy, bourbon, vanilla, molasses, dark chocolate and roasted malt. I like the taste a lot too, it's similar to the aroma but with the addition of some dark bread, burnt/charred malt, coffee, licorice and earthy flavors. There's a lot going on here, but all of the flavors mesh well together with no one flavor overpowering the others. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's coating and a bit syrupy with a moderate amount of carbonation. Nowhere near as boozy as I was expecting considering how strong this brew is! Certainly worth trying if you get the chance to!\n",
      "12/23 bottle: label removes mention of cognac and adds that it was aged for 2 years. ABV listed as 6%.\n",
      "Opens with a nice pop.\n",
      "L: Three finger head that quickly condenses. Hazy, golden body.\n",
      "S: Perfumey, funky peaches. The peach is the predominant aroma, but it sits behind a wall of slightly sour funkiness, hints of sea salt, and minerals.\n",
      "T: Oh so bright. A dash of mellow creamy fruit upfront is quickly overpowered by tart citrus and peach. Lemon zest, lime, oak, hints of mineral and berry, and of course peaches. A few pleasant floral, grassy notes finish things off, along with a slightly creamy, mineral aftertaste.\n",
      "F: Zippy, acidic, dry finish.\n",
      "O: It gets better with each sip. The body tickles the tongue but the finish is gentle and drawn out and really invites another sip.\n",
      "Backlog from Untappd. Tart, ripe fleshy peach. From May 2021.\n",
      "Never giving up on those childhood snacks de Garde takes the influence of fruit rollup and rolls it into a winey, earthy, tart and spicy wild ale. With lambic influences at the helm at well, this fruit rollup is corked, capped and ready for adulthood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pale gold and lightly of chrome, the light and yeasty haze of The Peach teems with bubbles while building a loose necklace of foam. Pulling from its white wine appearance, the session kicks of with a plume of stone fruit over a citrusy, tangy, earthy, briney perfume chocked full of both funk and fauna. As its mild mannered sweetness greets the tongue, the suggestions of communion wafer, sourdough and a hint of tafffy gives a soft and wheaten buffer to start.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the malt sweetness bounces effortlessly from the palate, the tastebuds soon carry the brunt of acidity that pangs away with lemon, lime, white grape, crabapple, yuzu and passionfruit with a stronger acidic twinge. All the while, the peach character gives a melon-like roundness for a smooth stone fruit taste. Nearly apricot, mango and orange-like, the bright and ripe peach flavor is radiant. Trending peppery with dry oak and lightly bittered hops, hints of grapefruit, grape seed and a mossy earthiness provide an earthy and peppery exit from the palate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Light, crisp and highly refreshing, the off-clean ale finishes briskly acidic with a series of short sourdough echoes laced with peppery white wine, saddle leather and oak tannin.\n",

      "\n",
      "Pours clear, light golden, with a small ghost of a head that disappears and leaves a tiny ring around the glass. Smell is tart and funky. A bit of wood, some dry chardonnay. Something musty. Very interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste is dry, tart, very chardonnay buttery, peach / stonefruit notes are there but kind of drowned out by the woody / chardonnay notes. Tartness is somewhere between unripe peaches and lemons. Mustiness is some combination of the butter and wood notes I think.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mouthfeel is medium to light, super dry, slight filminess, gives a sense of liveliness that might just be prickly acidity. Overall, it's good and very interesting.\n",
      "Cloudy yellowy orange body, white cap settles into a collar quickly. Big peach nose, big barnyard funk, lesser so horse blanket funk, oak more than the cognac support but both there, slight floral notes too. Tart and somewhat earthy peach starts the taste before the dry and sharp funk massages the oak and light cognac into the peach, apricot, lemon, green apple all support, but finish doesn't elevate, rather it goes somewhat acidic with a hint of balsamic vinegar. Feel is bright, sour, decently acidic cumulatively, and funky, almost feel more vinous on the finish. Very nice peach wild ale. The 6th best? No, but still great on a cool summer afternoon on the porch\n",
      "Pours jet black like coffee without creamer. Little to no carbonation. Thin in appearance and feel. The smell is noticeable as soon as cracking the bottle. The taste follows the smell, sweet cinnamon and coffee dominate with subtle hints of chocolate. Maple is faint but adds a nice sweetness. Chiles almost non existent but that’s fine by me. Really enjoyable after dinner drink.\n",
      "Taking brunch south of the boarder, Kane Brewing looks to chili peppers, cinnamon and cocoa to give a decidedly Mexican twist to their imperial milk porter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mexican Brunch kicks off with a very dark brown pour and a frothy cap that fades rather quickly. As a scent of coffee rises first, a quick followup of syrup, chocolate, nuttiness and spice ensure a complex and enticing scent. Fully malted and sweet on the tongue, high impressions of chocolate, caramel, maple, toffee and vanilla play out in hot chocolate fashion in its early impressions.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the flavors start to unfold, the middle palate holds onto its milky sweetness while the strong taste of coffee sets an earthy, nutty and roasty tone. Cinnamon and chilies mingle next for a sense of balance for the sweetness and to complement the coffee spice. Woodsy, earthy and toasty, the beer trails into a kahlua-like finish with balance and contrast in taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "Full bodied and soothing on the finish, the beer finishes both spicy and calmly with the milk sugars and maple rounding out the gradual simmer of peppers into a warming afterglow of a Mexican inspired, alcoholic cappuccino.\n",

      "I’ve actually had this on tap a few times and sent it out on BIFs and trades but never sat down with a bottle to concentrate on the beer.\n",
      "Until now.\n",
      "Pour is stout black with a 1 cm light brown head which left rings of lacing.\n",
      "The important part: the taste.\n",
      "It’s not like either of the stouts that make up the blend, or maybe cuvée.\n",
      "It’s a touch more coffee forward than Double Cream Stout and much less roasty than Expedition stout.\n",
      "It *is* amazingly tasty with smooth coffee and chocolate and daaaark fruits.\n",

      "Smell: Bourbon, vanilla, roasted malt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste: Tasted a lot like it smells, but with a bit more vanilla and malt sweetness. Some definite dark chocolate and milk chocolate notes. Some espresso-like coffee bitterness, but there is more bourbon at the finish that tempers it. Not getting any dried fruit flavors as per the label, but still quite tasty.\n",

      "Pours into my glass a solid black coffee color with a dense creamy tan head of .5 cm. the foam fades to a sturdy surface covering that remains through the sampling. i get some nice tight lattice when I swirl the glass or take a sip.\n",
      "Aroma is roasted malt, dark chocolate, some black licorice or anice note, bourbon notes and hints of black pepper. No hop character on the aroma and not fusol, but I believe the black pepper note is booze hint.\n",
      "First sip reveals a fairly thick body with smooth texture and full mouthfeel. Fine and tingly carbonation. Nice physical traits.\n",
      "Flavor is similar to the nose with high cacao dark chocolate, some black licorice, and finishes with some slightly sweet bourbon. Again no hop character on this beer. There isnt really a lot of boozy warmth on the finish here either.\n",
      "Pretty straight forward solid barrels aged stout, good complexity and blend of flavors. Very happy to have checked this beer and enjoying this tasty stout. The hidden ABV could be dangerous. Well worth seeking out.\n",

      "S: Bourbon barrel notes, chocolate, darkly roasted cereal grains, caramel.\n",
      "T: Mingling dark fruits, complex char, chocolate, dark berries, bourbon, wood barrel notes, dark caramelized malts, a bit nutty from the oaken barrels, finish is malty with espresso, bourbon, and sweet dark cocoa.\n",
      "F: Smooth & resilient heavy-bodied feel with a long finish that is fairly drying.\n",
      "O: Simply one of the finest BBA stouts I've had. Does not taste fake or adjunct-ridden as do many others. Smooth, rich, deep, long finish. Exceptional. Unlimited shelf life is touted but I'll get to the other 3 bottles this year. Good price point. This beer is absolutely world-class in its style.\n",
      "12oz bottled 10/31/23 (3+ months ago) poured into a tulip glass at fridge temp 11.4% ABV. The beer pours impenetrable black with medium brown colored head. The head recedes to a thin ring and island. Spotty lacing. The aroma is moderate in strength with bourbon soaked fudge brownie and lesser notes of ash and oak. The taste is bittersweet roasted malt with more bourbon, fudge brownie, oak and classic, ashy roasted malt character. The feel is medium plus bodied with just less that average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Overall, world class BBA imperial stout.\n",
      "Terrific stout! This is everything a barrel aged stout should be.\n",

      "\n",
      "F-Creamy...big but smooth...no heat from the ABV....not cloying....easy to drink...a rare beast with immense flavors but a drinkability that could lead to more than one if compelled.\n",

      "O-Love the taste of this and the way it drinks....sometimes with this style I'll really enjoy a particular offering but then have no craving to have it again to to the richness...that's not the case here despite it being plenty rich....aroma is a bit bland and one sided with the soy sauce maltiness...\n",

      "Aroma: Strong aromas of bittersweet chocolate, cream, cocoa upfront. Some hints of coffee roast and more cream in the middle. Mild bourbon underneath. (4.00)\n",
      "\n",
      "Flavor: Strong flavors of rich chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, cocoa, and cream upfront. Strong creamy chocolate notes linger before it evolves into a lactose and vanilla flavor. Some bourbon starts to balance, but ultimately the sweet chocolate cream overpowers and it finishes sweet and smooth. (4.25)\n",

      "\n",
      "Overall: Rated 100 World-Class on BeerAdvocate and ranked #33 for American Imperial Stout. Supposedly similar to their Expedition Stout, but aged in Bourbon Barrels. Upfront drinks very much like their Expedition Stout. A beer battle between the two would be far too dangerous. Dark, chocolate, creamy, and sweet. Some hints of bourbon and minimal roastedness. The bourbon is relatively hidden within the sweetness. This one leans sweeter and rich in typical Bells fashion. I wouldn't drink this often. A sipper and almost an occasional or dessert beer I'd say. (Rating: 4.12)\n",
      "Appearance: Black, ok head at first, fades to nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smell: Strong roast and char, molasses. Surprisingly little barrel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste: Dark chocolate, roasted malt, a little cherry alcohol hit, a splash of black coffee. Lots going on but the flavors are working together. As it warms up, the barrel starts showing up with some woody vanilla. Medium-heavy mouthfeel. More chocolate in the finish as it warms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall: Finally getting to try Black Note, total wine had a shelf full. Very nice BA stout. I've been a little hit-or-miss with Bell's big stouts, sometimes they are not quite sweet enough for my palate, but this beer hits the spot. Very Good!\n",

      "Smelled booze as soon as I cracked the bottle. Straight up bourbon. A closer sniff reveals tons of bourbon as expected, butterscotch, toasted oak, caramel, vanilla, very sweet and rich dark chocolate, toasted marshmallow, tobacco, prune, milk chocolate, and black licorice.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's still fairly cold--only been out of the fridge about 10 minutes--but the dark chocolate, molasses, toast, and caramel hit you upfront. Taste is surprisingly and dangerously smooth. Surprisingly, it doesn't lean heavily on cloy of dark chocolate/caramel/vanilla, though there is that. It actually leans fruity; candied plum, black cherry, and fig. Charred oak tannins contribute nudges of red wine. Tobacco, leather, and smoke on the mid-palate. Heavy char; black coffee and burnt toast. Bourbon warmth takes over, zinging and drying out the palate. Heavy astringency. The sweetness hits you on the finish--slick, oily, syrupy--but the booze and heavy tannins keep it in check. The finish lingers with chocolate, coffee, fruit leather, bourbon, and smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feel is lighter than expected but still heavy. Oily, slick, greasy, sugary. Medium to medium carbonation; it moves rather quickly on the palate. Mouthfeel is more like a carbonated brandy or port than your typically milkshake-like imperial stout.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do I feel about this beer overall? It's hard to give an honest opinion, because everyone is so biased about it that it affects our collective judgment. It's very good and mold-breaking, but maybe not 100. I prefer the thicker feel and chocolate-coffee forward taste of other imperial stouts that are lower-abv. (Because I'm getting old lol)\n",
      "Definitely don't regret buying/trying it, but I don't think I will again unless I share it with several other people.\n",
      "Black Tuesday pours black with a small, long-lasting tan head. The aroma is sweet figs and bourbon. The flavor is big, bold, and hot but it blends in with all the dark chocolate notes and sweet bourbon notes. Good, thick body. Overall, just about a perfect stout. Huge flavors, and completely hides the 19.5 abv.\n",
      "On tap into an 8 oz snifter, pours pitch black, as per the name. Smell and taste feature a complex blend of raisins, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, oak and bourbon. The alcohol warms going down, but is very well hidden. Not overly thick or sweet. Outstanding beer.\n",
      "Pitch black viscous body with a brown cap. Smells is luxurious: full vanilla backed by rye whiskey, bourbon, molasses, semi-sweet chocolate, marshmallow and caramel in that order of strength. Taste is very sweet, vanilla and marshmallow push the barrels to the limit, leaving the boozy parts to shine with a sweetened chocolate fudge. Feel is heavy yet not as thick as it looks, very smooth with warmth emerging from the cool vanilla stout base\n",

      "Old school piney crisp westie. Just a style that isn't brewed enough these days, and it's a real shame. Kick you in the teeth bitter - pours a delicious golden amber, and perfectly carbed. Very sippable. Not sure it lives up to the god-like status some hold it in, but it's a very solid west coast IPA.\n",
      "Not sure why people feel the need to write reviews along the lines of \"it's an old style not fit for today's trends\".......it was brewed to be a piney, bitter, and malty beer and it's damn well crafted. If you were into trendy scotch drinks and were handed a glass of Louis XIII Cognac, would you poo-poo it for being different? Old school west coast IPA's exist for a reason, and they have certain qualities that make them different from the trendier new england style. This beer is a fantastic brew, with pine and malt flavors bursting onto the scene in a way you just don't find with most beers made elsewhere. When you take a sip, you just know it is a well crafted, and balanced brew.\n",
      "No. No, no, no. I can't understand how everyone takes this well-balanced yet boring double IPA and elevates it to a godly status. It's fine, but the flavors, scent, and mouthfeel stop there. As a California born dude, I above all want to champion our beers. This is fine, but it's just not the champ.\n",
      "Many reviews talk about the perfect balance between malt and hops displayed by this beer. They're not wrong. This beer has seen the tightrope strung across the canyon of drinkability and confidently trod the cord, using malt and hops as its balance beam while declining to use any of the 2020s' juiciness for a safety net.\n",
      "\n",
      "Make no mistake, this is a bitter beer. It demands an experienced drinker's palate, but rewards the garnered experience of a craft beer drinker with a beer that displays subtle citrus notes, a strong yet not overbearing malt backbone and a hoppy, piney, resinous kick that unashamedly proclaims its double IPA genes.\n",

Bottled just about two years ago, which isn't too long in wild ale years, but I was surprised to find that whatever intended refermentation in the bottle didn't really seem to have worked out. The beer poured almost still with a distinct pee color. Barnyard-forward funky aromas -- hay, horse, must, herbal hop, and a bit of apricot. Taste has a good amount of that crushed aspirin bitterness alongside lemon, wheat, grapefruit juice, wildflower honey, and chardonnay grapes. Pleasant but fairly boilerplate spontaneous ale. Feel is not great due to the fermentation issues -- only the lightest of discernible effervescence. Overall a bit of a let down, but maybe it's just a bad bottle\n",

The taste is superb with a great balance between tart lemon, lime, and grapefruit, and sweeter notes of pineapple, tangerine, peach, and some tropical fruit. Beneath is a creamy, oaty base that adds sweetness. It's dank but not overly bitter. The mouth feel is luxuriously plush and creamy with a perfect level of carbonation, and the 10% ABV is barely noticeable. Overall, this ale is outstanding and it's important to remember that it was first brewed 7 years ago. We've become accustomed to New England IPAs with heavy New Zealand hops.

Small amount of lacing. I like the aroma, the brew smells like chocolate, vanilla, bourbon and roasted malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some burnt/charred malt, dark bread, oak, molasses and a bit of dark fruit. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's rich and coating with a moderate amount of carbonation. It's a little boozy but doesn't quite seem like it's 19.1% ABV either.

Nose has a leathery, molasses and salty licorice Black Tuesday backbone melded with semi-sweet chocolate chips. Some vanilla and oak as well. Nothing overpowering, and all the aromas feel like they're integrated into the beer, rather than an adjunct or flavoring that's thrown in on top and feels \"artificial.\" Taste follows - it lacks the overpowering leathery and brackish boldish of Black Tuesday, but the cocoa additional doesn't tilt this sweet. Instead, it takes some of the rougher edges off BT while still maintaining an overall \"savory\" (or at least, no sweet) stout. Lots of alcohol, barrel, and bourbon spice lingers nicely on the loooong finish. Plenty of heat as well, but again, not overpowering. I do find the feel a little thing (similar to Gray Monday), but not everything needs the chew of BCBS. I still prefer BT, but this is a fine variant.\n",

      "Full on sweet and creamy coffee in beer form, I'm in love.\n",
      "Looks like motor oil, completely opaque. Foam like dalgona coffee. Notes of molasses, vanilla, and coconut on the nose. Taste is nicely balanced, with tons of bittersweet chocolate. Nice mouthfeel, not too heavy. Overall a great stout, perfect for a late fall day.\n",
      "Appearance - The beer poured a silky black color with brown bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smell - the nose had a strong coffee presence with noted sweetness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste -There was a lot of coffee here. Notes of chocolate syrup, and light vanilla we’re also present. It was not overly sweet to the point of being calling and allowing the coffee to shine. The coffee and chocolate continued in the finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mouthfeel - The body was slick and not overly thick with small bubbles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall - This is a great stout that coffee stout lovers will love.\n",
      "I usually like to sample a base beer before dipping into variants. However, when it comes to TH, I take what I can get when I can get it. So, I tried the Espresso version of this beer before sampling the OG version that is before me now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pours a deep dark brown-to-black color with over a finger of head that is milk chocolate in color. Like the Espresso variant, I am not overly impressed by the nose - some coffee, not much else.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flavor profile is dominated by fresh black coffee. The bitterness off the roasted beans is the highlight here. The body is hearty and the finish has just enough residual sweetness to counteract the bitter coffee.\n",
      "Jet black body, opaque; thick, frothy, light brown head, long lasting; patchy splotches of foam stick to the glass. Rich dark roasted malt smell; cacao nibs and bitter chocolate. Rich and flavorful taste; fine blend of sweet and bitter chocolate; chocolate fudge and brownies; bourbon undercurrent; bitter. Heavy body; heavy sweetness throughout with a mild dryness at the finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah, a coffee stout, eh? After the fact I can sense coffee, but it's well-hidden on my palate. Still, this is a rich, decadent stout and quite the treasure.\n",

      "The triple-J version makes the leap from very good to great! This version maintains its juiciness but also provides a potent dose of grapefruit-like bitterness to the finish.\n",
      "I was expecting a more explosive galaxy profile. There is definitely mango in there. Maybe some nectarine. Definitely a bit ripe and green. Body is a little thick for me. It's definitely good. Not necessarily disappointed, but was expecting a more expressive experience from this one.\n",

      "It’s surprisingly smooth and balanced in taste but I really dig it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting orange zest, overripe cantaloupe, crackery malt, grassy hops, dank weed, mango skin, pineapple juice, and white grape. The swallow brings notes of orange zest, lime zest, white grape, jammy peach, bready malt, grassy hops, dank weed, and mango skin\n",

      "\n",
      "O - Really top notch coffee stout.\n",

      "Smell - So much coffee in the nose, accompanied by rich dark chocolate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste - In the initial taste, there was a big wave of coffee. The coffee ran parallel to roasty dark chocolate. There were hints of cherry and coconut. The finish came with dry hints of the barrel.\n",

      "Mouthfeel - With little carbonation, the beer was very smooth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall - This was elite.\n",
      "Rounded up to 4.5 based on general drinkability.\n",
      "Poured at 53°. Creamy light tan head with some rocks; good cap retention; heavy ring; sudsy lacing on agitation; medium thick legs; black body with ruby see through and good clarity. Bourbon and some mild roast coffee in nose; oak takes over as beer warms. Taste is bitter roast coffee, bitter sweet dark chocolate and oaky bourbon; a smidge of oaky vanilla in middle; black peppery oaky close. Medium body; silky feel, not adjuncty; alcohol burn on tip of tongue, warmth in mouth from 13.8% abv; dry wooden tongue coating/finish. Overall the beer tastes good but it’s too oaky for me; the coffee is bitter and the barrel notes push aside the base, i.e., oak dominates the whole and leaves a dry popsicle stick linger in my mouth.\n",
      "This is drier than most of its peers with a seemingly darker roast coffee as well. There really isn't much here besides bittersweet chocolate and intensely deep, dark coffee notes. The bourbon barrels are mellow but a welcome addition. Well incorporated bourbon and some oaky bite at the end. So damn good.\n",
      "2022 vintage, Drank 08/31/23\n",
      "Pours a jet black with little carbonation. Strong aroma of morning coffee with chocolate syrup. Palate is choc covered espresso beans soaked in bourbon barrels. Great mouthfeel, with a gentle sweetness that’s not overpowering and very smooth given the ABV. Absolutely perfect and easily the best BA coffee stout I’ve had.\n",

      "\n",
      "Boozy, oaky, toasty, lightly charred, with perhaps even more flavor (following the nose) in the finish than on the palate. Wave after wave of malt and barrel complexity. Bittersweet and almost but never quite smokey/spicy. Mild bitterness throughout, earthy/woodsy medium-dry finish with hints of black tea and bourbon.\n",

      "Slippery, almost oily mouth-feel, with some residual tannins.\n",

Flavors of intense coffee, roasted malt, bourbon, chocolate, oak. Smooth, a solid full body, appropriately carbonated.\n",

      "\n",
      "It trends much more bitter in taste, but that underlying sweetness helps things from getting out of hand. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting molasses, earthy hops, cacao nib, dark roast coffee, plum, rye toast, burnt caramel, light vanilla, and brown sugar. The swallow brings notes of cacao nib, dark roast coffee, burnt toast, toasted oak, black cherry, caramel, earthy hops, light plum, and molasses\n",

      "Taste -roasted malt coffee dark chocolate barrel, slightly bitter\n",
      "Feel -creamy full body light carb\n",
      "Overall - pretty great\n",
      "Aroma is boozy bourbon with a bit of classic chocolaty stout -- jammy molasses and plum. Body is strong with bourbon followed shortly by roasty coffee, and the two combine to make something like a mounds bar with a swig of strong black coffee. One of the best examples of a good barrel aged stout out there.\n",
      "04/27/23 bottle @ home\n",
      "Pitch black pour with a full brown head. The nose is great: espresso added to usual parabola, but the barrel not cut at all. Taste is coffee and chocolate forward, barrel is rustic, roasted malt parabola base is still great. Body is a touch thinner but still earthy, rustic, and boozy with roast. This is well done but I like the original best still\n",

      "Aroma is monstrous tropical citrus along with dank sticky resinous pine. Yes. Smells like rubbing a handful of hop cones together.\n",
      "\n",
      "The beer hits the palate hard with an unapologetic bitter hop bite, resinous and chewy. Behind that are copious hop oils and alpha acids that give off an explosion of citrus flavors—grapefruit mostly, like licking the inside of the rind. Definitely an underlying layer of pale malt sweetness too, like peaches maybe a day past peak ripeness. Finishes again with a tingling sharp hop bite. Bold and assertive, but still balanced. This contains 11.5% alcohol?\n",

      "Medium orange, with amber highlights, for the look. Solid amount of toasted grain, caramel malt, tangerine peel, for the aroma. Lots of tangerine peel, caramel malt flavors. The extra malt, tames the hop bite, as usual.\n",
      "Hoppy and piney, with bitter grapefruit that counterbalances the alcohol sweetness from the tripe IPA makes it surprisingly drinkable for 12% abv.\n",
      "Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a two finger white head with great retention and solid lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, orange, mild mixed tropical fruit and pine;a touch of green onion. Flavor is lightly caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, mixed tropical fruit and pine needles. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. So great to find an traditional triple IPA with real malt flavor, lots of fruit and pine and substantial bitterness in the finish. I was struck but the mild sweetness of this one, but with all the mixed fruit it fit perfectly. Some hotness, but plenty of flavor to cover the ABV well. Boneyard has always pleased with IPAs and I'm not sure why I've never seen this one in my area before. I'll be looking for it in the future. Excellent.\n",
      "Look: Nearly clear rich orange with a reddish hue and the pour yields a thick pure white head that pillows up and slowly recedes, leaving great lacing behind\n",
      "Aroma: I could smell it before I got close to the glass. Sweet orange, peach, strawberries, pine sap, cantaloupe, a little Cannabis, rich honey-like sweetness, ruby-red grapefruit, Hawaiian bread, tangerine, and an ever-so-slight ethanol waft\n",
      "Taste: Whoa. A huge rush of mixed citrus fruits storm onto the palate as honey-like sweetness and berries start to mix in. Pine and dank herb appear from time to time and malt sweetness is ever-present and closes with a big hop bite and alcohol heat\n",
      "Mouthfeel: Full, slick, slightly cloying but far from palate-taxing, and decently dry on the finish along with some alcohol heat\n",
      "Overall: This is a big-time beer and a good one at that. This was my first time with this beer in years and was pumped when I saw they had finally canned it (or packaged it at all) but glad it’s not around often as it’s a huge Triple IPA and it shows. Tons of hops, tons of malt sweetness, boozy, and unabashedly so - you know it’s big but doesn’t drink like it’s 11.5%. A well done and tasty IIIPA. Recommended.\n",

      "Pours a silky, jet-mahogany body capped with two and a half fingers of soapy, beige foam; solid head retention leaves a slim-none cap over an otherwise dense void, paper-thin collar, and minimal, temporary webs of lacing holding to the walls of the glass.\n",

      "Mouthfeel offers a medium body and moderate carbonation, fading as subtle roast coats and a slick, balancing texture washes over the mid-palate; creaminess into burgeoning warmth settles through the back end while a wispy, semi-bitter prickle finishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Expressive coffee welcomes sleek vanilla, with bourbon simultaneously softening roast and mediating a beautifully deft cinnamon accent; an expertly done combination of adjuncts, layered over the profile approachably and with purpose.\n",
      "All high ABV porters should be bourbon barrel aged in my opinion. This one is and well done. Super dark in color with a light brown head. Nose is bourbon and caramel. Taste is like toasted cane sugar and caramel. The slight burn from the ABV is not overwhelming, yet has a bit of hang around power. The feel goes all the way down the esophagus.\n",

Nose fruity citrus; melon; biscuit and resin…somewhat subdued from can and glass. Taste mirrors with greater orange fwd (as promised). Body began as smooth velvet, but became more brisk after about 1/3 glass consumed. Overall an excellent NE style DIPA. Began as a stunner, but evolved into a still great brew but not as extraordinary as hoped.\n",
      "Apricot juice color. Cloudy. Impressively large head from a gentle pour. Many rings of chunky lace left on the glass as the beer is consumed.\n",

      "Initial impression is of orange rind, light caramel, and deeper toasted bread. Light hop bitterness is like a subtle spice. Softly sweet.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are flavors of dried apricot and rye bread. The hop is stronger than the smell suggests bringing forward a black pepper bite. Fuller body and fine carbonation. The finish is a blend of semisweet caramel, warming alcohol, and prickly pepper. Soft but lingering aftertaste.\n",
      "Pours a completely opaque, thicc looking drab orange color. Thick, frothy, off-white head forms on the beer, lingers for a moment, then dissipates leaving just a small mound of residual foam. Sticky lacing coats the glass as the beer is consumed. Aroma has notes of guava, passionfruit, orange, citrus, and some tropical fruits. Absolutely lovely on the nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste somewhat follows the nose - those fruity notes are there - orange, passion fruit, and guava amongst others - but the flavor profile is decidedly less fruity than the nose implied. Moderate hoppy bitterness comes through in the profile. Nice balance between the fruity sweetness and the hoppy bitterness. Feel is thick, a bit heavy, and very full bodied. Nice carbonation for as heavy as the beer actually ends up being.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall it is a lovely NEIPA - a testament to the quality of Tree House.\n",
      "I had no idea that a stout could taste like this, flat out delicious, if a little sweet. But somehow it works so very well. The feel is more like a BBA Stout but it’s not. Wow, I want a case of this.\n",
      "Pours a bit more viscous than most classic stouts with a warm tan head. This beer is roughly 8mo old so the nose isn’t super pronounced but is not unsatisfying. Very faded coffee and chocolate w maple syrup. Body is definitely syrupy and a bit sticky.\n",
      "\n",

      "Pours a deep dark brown-to-black color with a finger and a half of tan head. The nose is ludicrously good - it smells like milk chocolate syrup poured over crushed bittersweet chocolate pieces! The flavor faithfully follows the nose. The body is hearty for the style and the mouthfeel is sticky sweetness galore.\n",
      "Milkshake quality. Truly delicious\n",
      "Near perfect, had in 2019\n",
      "On tap at Modern Times Fermentorium. Pours black with pretty much zero head. The nose is phenomenal. Tons of vanilla, marshmallow, chocolate, and bourbon. The taste follows, with massive amounts of vanilla leading the way. Just a lovely viscous stout.\n",

      "\n",
      "Poured into a snifter, it was the color of the mood of Philadelphia Eagles fans right now. Virtually no head besides a very thin line of tan bubbles around the rim. Not a great looking beer, but it's not surprising considering how strong it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "As expected, it smells like a big Stout brewed with the adjunct ingredients of vanilla and bourbon barrels, with an unexpected touch of what smells like Graham crackers. Smells like a luscious dessert.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tastes like it smells, but better. It's not a subtle beer, but you don't drink beers like this for subtlety. The bourbon Barrel flavor is fairly mellow and refined, and the vanilla is at a level that melts well with that, unlike a lot of beers I've had with vanilla added to it. That Graham crackery thing I noticed in the nose is present in the taste as well. I do not believe any graham crackers were abused in the making of this beer, perhaps it's a byproduct of the vanilla and bourbon mixing. It is utterly delicious, that's for sure.\n",

      "F: Thick, smooth, and luscious.\n",

      "Flavor absolutely delivers on a classic, BCBS-like BBA imperial stout. Lots of bourbon, but not overpowering; moderate char; bitter, but not overly hoppy nor too roasty, coming across on the more restrained side of RIS. Toffee, ginger cookies, raisin, coffee, prune, bourbon, oak, leather, white pepper, blackstrap molasses.\n",

      "This is an excellent BA RIS, with tons of complexity and an admirable restraint on all fronts. It's supremely drinkable, and less rich than most others, without sacrificing flavor. That said, I personally wish it delivered more richness along with that complexity, perhaps just a touch more sweetness and thickness. I also favor AIS over RIS, which certainly influences my take on this one.\n",
      "Plead the 5th from Dark Horse Brewing. 12 oz can. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Received from @Whyteboar in NBW BIF #16. Reviewed 05/12/22. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.\n",
      "Undated can. Served at 53.4 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 57.7 degrees.\n",

      "First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), clear.\n",
      "Body – Brown (SRM 20), opaque. Under direct light, same. When rear lite, opaque except at the edges – bottom edge ruby, top edge olive.\n",
      "Head – Average (Maximum 1.2 cm, aggressive center pour), buff, high density with a few surface rocks, quickly diminishing to a 0.1 – 0.15 cm crown and a thin island.\n",

      "Flavor – 4.5 – Chocolate and slight char with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Bourbon not detected. Slight oakiness. No hops or yeast. No ethanol (11 % ABV as marked on label) aroma or taste. Moderate gastric warming occurs. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.\n",
      "Palate – 4 – Medium, dry side of creamy, soft but lively carbonation.\n",
      "Final impression and summation: 4 (After deducting 0.25 point for undated personal container) Look unremarkable, pretty much like every other high ABV RIS or Impy stout. Aroma is fairly typical but has a char note that many lack and lacks the coffee notes that many have. Bourbon is present on the nose but seems absent in the taste. The taste also has both chocolate and char as well as an oakiness from vanillin but lacks the tannin notes. As the temperature reaches the end, some bourbon notes finally appear. Overall, a good RIS that’s certainly more subtle than most.\n",
      "I had a 2016 and was curious what 6 years of aging would do. Definitely mellowed it out a bit and knocked off the rougher edges. Mostly left with a mellow oak and vanilla bourbon flavor over a nice toasty base stout. Quite nice.\n",
      "Look - Fantastic black and thick with a really nice thick foamy tan head\n",
      "Smell - dark chocolate caramel molasses roasted malts boozy and bourbon woody smells\n",

      "Overall - Really nice Classic BA Russian Imperial. Very complex with a ton of smells and flavors.\n",
      "Pours jet black like used motor oil. Has a medium dark caramel head on top. Gives off a burnt coffee smell. Taste of roasted burning malts. Barrel is nowhere to be found. Overall beer is delicious!!\n",

      "This is good, but some of their pales and singles are better imo. Funny to see which ones get hype and make the top 250 list. This honestly is a bit light on flavor in comparison to some of their lesser abv hops. Still juicy and tropical. Mango, papaya, orange, melon. Also some bitterness. Floral and pine. It’s good, just can’t see why the avg rating is so high on this specific offering.\n",

      "Splendid looking beer. Hazy pale amber body with a strong persistent white head. The lacing is truly spectacular, dripping rings.

Rich sweetness and well balance combination of chocolate, bourbon and vanilla (much more present than in aroma), hints of coffee and maltiness. Full mouthfeel. Incredible stout.\n",
      "12 ounce bottle poured into a Firestone Walker taster’s snifter, in Toulouse, France. (One of the beers I brought from the USA 7 months ago.) There’s a bracelet of foam that lingers round the top of the black brew. No retention cuz there’s nothing to retain.\n",
      "Nose is dry woodsy bourbon and espresso.\n",
      "Taste is bourbon barrel, roasty malt, a little char, and quite alcohol forward., There is dark chocolate and coffee, but this is almost straight hot bourbon. Late in the taste, it finally settles down enough to allow some vanilla and hops whisper through. There are few subtle notes. It’s overkill, really, and the base brew is overwhelmed.\n",
      "Mouthfeel is light for such heaviness. Carbonation is relatively low.\n",
      "Overall, Speedway’s base Stout and coffee addition is damn good. Dumping it in a bourbon barrel is like a really beautiful woman wearing way too much makeup.\n",

      "Poured oil-like into our glasses, black as a moonless night and capped with a brown head they left reasonable lacing.\n",
      "Sadly, my nose is Covid damaged and the aroma was too faint for me to properly describe.\n",
      "The taste though - Speedway is one of our favorite stouts as it is, and this one is easily just as tasty, just differently so. More smooth and bourbon like heat that accompanies the existing coffee and dark chocolate flavors; all bitterness from the coffee or malt roast is gone. If BBA stouts are a treat for you, seek this out.\n",
      "The feel is soft and the visible viscosity doesn't let me down. It feels like a high ABV stout and seems to need all that body to carry the amount of flavor packed into this.\n",
      "Poured a dark chocolate fudge with half finger light brown head. Excellent lacing throughout the tasting. Nose was good, though muted - soft vanilla and barrel. Taste was more forward with the vanilla, barrel, light coffee, and some chocolate. Overall, very good beer. Would prefer a bit more barrel and a bit more coffee.\n",
      "Pours inky black with a thick mocha head that leaves spotty lacing. Aroma is dark chocolate, oak, vanilla, bourbon. Flavor follows the nose, heavenly chocolate cake, bourbon and vanilla. Feel is thick and lightly carbonated. Overall, the bomb.\n",

      "\n",
      "S: dark chocolate cake, espresso ganache, hint of charcoal... powerful grain and toasty cookie character... nutty accents and a prune brandy booze note slowly emerge... bourbon is not immediately apparent I think due to the heavy dark malty aromas, but delicate wood and vanilla overtones eventually meld with the rest of its potent snuffables\n",
      "\n",
      "T: the bourbon barrel influence leaps out upon first sip but soon gets swallowed by the muddy, motor oily, muscular malts... cindery heat, burnt raisiny... thick malty but not all that sweet(?!?); the aftertaste seems dry; all suggestive byproducts\n",
      "\n",
      "F: full bodied is pretty spot on, however, it has a slick, lithe texture likely from being smoothed with aging, not to mention the attenuating effect of the jet fuel booze... gets fluffier as it goes?... it's levity is phenomenal, but I like my legs\n",
      "\n",
      "O: it doesn't quite have the subtle idiosyncratic nuances of the best batches of standard Bourbon County, but why am I comparing them?... Eh, tempting to ship home (2273)\n",
      "16oz can pours out that inkish black that's so familiar in Speedway, with a decent-sized tight-bubbled light khaki head. Prominent barrel notes of bourbon and oak abound, along with present coffee and hints of smoke...rich and sweet on the palate, the barrel-aging seems well-executed here. Definitely worth trying, I liked this variant more than the Vietnamese coffee version; this one just seemed more cohesive, roasty, rich, and pleasant.\n",
      "Color: DDH King Sue pours a hazy golden-orange with a rich, slightly creamy appearance, typical of New England-style IPAs. Its opacity is inviting, and a thick, white frothy head crowns the beer, leaving excellent lacing as it settles.\n",
      "Aroma: The aroma bursts with tropical fruits, led by a strong scent of mango, pineapple, and citrus, especially grapefruit and tangerine. There’s also a hint of peach and papaya, complemented by underlying pine and resin notes. The double dry-hopping of Citra hops shines through, delivering a vibrant, juicy nose.\n",
      "Palate: On the palate, DDH King Sue is smooth and juicy, with a pillowy mouthfeel. The tropical flavors from the aroma carry over, with ripe mango, pineapple, and passion fruit dominating. A slight citrus bite balances out the sweetness, while the hop bitterness is present but not overpowering. The soft carbonation and hazy body give it a velvety texture, making it incredibly drinkable for a Double IPA.\n",
      "Overall: DDH King Sue is a standout New England-style Double IPA. Its combination of intense tropical fruit flavors, a balanced hop profile, and smooth mouthfeel make it both bold and approachable. Fans of juicy, hazy IPAs will find this beer a real treat, showcasing why it’s so highly regarded in the craft beer community. Despite its higher ABV (around 7.8%), it remains refreshing and easy to enjoy.\n",
      "Cloudy orange color, like fresh orange juice with pulp, with a modest off white head.\n",
      "The aroma is tropical fruit and tart citrus.\n",
      "The taste is mango, pineapple, grapefruit and tangerine overdose, slightly sweet, tart and mildly bitter nicely balanced for loads of flavor. The finish is dry with loads of citrus zest bite.\n",
      "The body is medium, plenty of good carbonation, crisp but very drinkable with a well hidden ABV. Altogether, this is another great super hazy IPA from Toppling Goliath, almost hop overload but luscious, outstanding.\n",
      "A - Pours out semi-translucent pale orange, short white head, fading pretty quickly to a nothing. Not much lacing, really.\n",
      "\n",
      "S - Fruit nectar, primarily, a tropical element hard to put a finger on, but a strong citrus undercurrent, mostly grapefruit.\n",
      "\n",
      "T - Follows the nose, with a big tropical juice note, more clearly pineapple and passionfruit, mango and a touch of peach, that flows into a citrus hit of orange and grapefruit in the middle, and a subtle bitterness of pith, with powerful acidity in the finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "M - Strong acidity and moderate carbonation do battle against the heavier juice notes, scrubbing away most of the weight. A dry finish leaves just a touch of resin in the close.\n",
      "\n",
      "O - I do like this one, with huge juice notes and just enough bitterness to remind you this is still a beer you are drinking. Lovely, and satisfying.\n",
      "Poured from a can into a snifter. Pours hazy orange yellow with a small white head. Smells of citrus and grassy hops with floral notes. Tastes of bright citrus with some creamy notes. Beer is medium bodied with a nice smooth finish, good carbonation. Overall, a superb beer.\n",
      "Look - bright hazy orange with a nice white head sticky rimming and lacing\n",
      "Smell - tropical fruit and slightly floral\n",

      "SMELL: pleasantly understated, notes of sweet pineapple citrus and mango then bread.\n",

      "\n",
      "OVERALL: this is a spectacular Pale Ale, I will buy this again for sure and will tell all my friends about it, I recommend to anyone who likes craft beer, Toppling Goliath is one of the best brewers there is, right there with Sierra Nevada, can't wait to try more beers from them.\n",

      "Poured from a can into a pint glass. Pours hazy yellow orange with a small white head. Smells of bright citrus with some pine notes. Tastes of grassy and citrus hops. Beer is light bodied and easy drinking, good carbonation. Overall, a very good beer.\n",
      "On tap, pours a moderately hazy orange. Smell and taste showcase the Citra, with citrus, tropical fruits and musky, herbal notes. Really nice beer, enjoyable.\n",

      "Light to medium velvety body with appropriate carbonation of tiny bubbles.\n",
      "Beef up version of Pseudo Sue with similar tropical and citrusy fresh notes and a pinch of dank-resin. A tad more intense than the original. Showcase for an American Pale Ale.\n",
      "Pours cloudy orange color with a 2 finger white foamy head that faded slowly and left decent foamy lacing. Smells of tangerine, lemon zest, grapefruit, tea leaf, honeydew melon, coriander and light peppery spices. Tastes of red grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, tea leaf, honeydew melon, orange peel, caramel, wheat bread/sweet malt, coriander and light peppery spices. Well balanced and easy drinking, this was a nice IPA.\n",
      "From January 13, 2024 via my Untappd \"Wow. I've been actively avoided hazies, but Tree House is always a treat. This is great!\" Shout out to my buddy for the share!\n",
      "Pours a very hazy mango color with a fluffy white head that coats the glass with ringlets of lacing. Gorgeous hazy. The nose is crammed with dank citrus notes, primarily mango, tangerine, and lemon zest, with some subtle white grape notes for good measure. Wow.\n",
      "\n",
      "The taste follows that script, with the mango and tangerine most prominent and delicious, with the lemon zest and white grape lurking, and some sweet oats at the back of the palate, coasting into a pillowy mouthfeel and a surprising bit of lingering bitterness.\n",

      "A steady, well-attenuated dankness rife with tropical overlay; a standard NEIPA in the ever-quaffable Tree House rotation.\n",
      "Poured from 16-ounce can into a thin-walled crystal goblet. Hazy pale yellow, with a two-finger white head that left scads of pretty lacing. Big burst of grapefruit upon opening the can, and it only got better. Loads of grapefruit, orange, and tropical fruit on the nose and palate (think breakfast juice). Very low bitterness, with hints of citrus zest lingering on the finish. Satisfying mouthfeel, very juicy. Well balanced and very drinkable, i.e. goes down easily and you just want to keep drinking it. First time with Tree House, and I'm suitably impressed. Highly recommended.\n",

      "\n",
      "T: Taste follows with a big plastic like funk up front, which quickly yields to floral and citrus notes, with big oaky vanilla on the finish that lingers forever. Taste is quite tart and sour but it’s not as puckering as many lambics. The raspberry characters are present but certainly not prominent, not sure to what extent that’s due to the age. 4.5\n",

Not sure if it was worth the difficulty in obtaining as I think I prefer Cantillon Rose de Gabrinus when it comes to Raspberry lambics (and I’ve surprisingly found the other easy to get over the years).

      "A: The decanter tinges vermilion on the initial impact, which transfers to a vivid – metallic – orange. That luminosity tops a deep saffron base with a pastel orange hue, as gamboge tones streak throughout. Proportionately, an askew cap that comes to a vista white inch, while steadily downsizing to the ½ in, where the palette succumbs a snow drift highlight. The configuration has the hydrophobic polypeptides & bitter acids to modestly cling, when retreating to the ¼ in. At this point, a latticework with a residual nuance to dimly stick, as the retention retains an enacting solidity. Albeit, shy on the aesthetic decree, seeing the descending collar to the minute. The layouts have a transparency upon the transfers, which have an opulent appeal early on, while a circuitous convention develops amid the pressing radiations\n",
      "\n",
      "S: A density set to esters, as they constantly web around the oak casks, while the grain bill pitches a smart rusticity. There is an isoamyl octanoate innuendo near the persuasive peach accompaniments, which takes a Torani Syrup form. In this respect, a softly tart & fuzzy recording that’s lightly backed, by the oak tannin exchanges, while the hop effect lends a floral regularity. The phenolic compounds gradually characterize on cobwebs, aside a ripened mustiness, given the vintage works over the decant. However, a narrow presentation on the inaugurating course, as the directive is more symphonic to the seeds and skins above the alluding crops. The advancements have a stronger denotation on the aged strains with a grain bill that ties in pit + trench silos, while maintaining a profitable presence on esters. Markedly, a harmonization amongst the ranching & pastoral foregrounds to the milder fruits ascribing pears, berries, and apricots. Moreover, an undercroft ease on the °F upticks, while a dry Torrontés similitude dispatches, besides the barrel aldehydes. The cessations retain an earthed ruralism against the – loitering – eugenol structures, beyond the leathery tannin constitutes\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Fermentable complexities with a soft cask neatness, which traits ethyl acetates to porous oak codas. Namely, an oxidized kindliness that has a solvent growth under fresh clingstone peaches, which impute seedy connotations per the inferred pits. The French oak barrel offers mild spices to complex polymers, where phenolic aldehydes pitch vanillin. Meanwhile, malt backs the bready accounts with Dorset knobs & pie crusts, as hops back a longleaf pine essence, while ketones casually mingle. Chiefly, an inducement on raspberry ketones alongside strawberries & melons, before connoting emerald drop pluots. A buildout on fleshed fruit to palm syrup, as catacomb dust delicately descends on Golden Silk Spiders. Coupled with, cattle yard atmospheres to leathery tannins, as a transferred aridity elevates above the rustic granularities. The timing to weather – over the course – reverberates that inaugurating solvency thru an Oloroso Sherry implementation, which offers an oxidative nuttiness to exotic thickets. On the rear side, a perceptible murmur on cloves & nutmeg, while guaiacols quietly coat the codicils over smoke, as polyphenol compounds dictate\n",
      "\n",
      "M: There is a passing rain to flagstone texture, from a minerality component that later transcends on seafronts. The surface is soft with calm acidic natures, given the modest vivacities, which attenuate steadily. In consequence, a dry formation that benefits over the cask scriptures, when depicting the hydrolysable substances\n",
      "\n",
      "O: Yeast grandiosities that are perceptively backed across the bitter – earthy – hop effects, while phenolic companions lurk. On balance, a sensitive malt mannerism with a loyal intention to not annihilate the course, as the French oak barrels impress. The timetables are advantageous to the vintage over an improved dryness, from cut sugars to cranked up/interconnected esters\n",

      "I have reached 2200 reviews/beers. I never thought I would get over 1000 reviews when I started this. I am looking forward to the next 100 until it comes time for 5000 reviews. For this milestone, I chose a behemoth, Grey Monday, from 2019. The name 'Grey Monday' is a nod to the intense, complex flavors of this beer, which make it a perfect choice for a contemplative, rainy day. I was using a tulip glass and served the beer at 50 degrees. The pour created a frothy, airy, one-fingered, light tan head with poor retention. The semi-quick retention left no lacing on the glass. The color is inky black and opaque, charting at SRM 38. This beer is beautiful; I am okay with the quick dissipation because of the 20.8 ABV.\n",
      "Bringing the glass to my nose, I'm greeted by a symphony of aromas. The massive oak barrel, the intense bourbon, the nutty, and chocolate notes all dance together. Nosing the glass again, I pick up on the subtler hints of coffee, tobacco, char, earthy tones, alcohol, molasses, raisins, figs, caramel, toffee, Maillard, burnt sugar, nutty, vanilla, light char, and oranges. This beer is a sensory adventure, with each aroma adding a new layer to its complexity.\n",
      "The first sip of Grey Monday is a revelation. The flavors burst forth, starting with a massive nuttiness that's a perfect blend of chocolate, coffee, bourbon, char, and oak. It's like a delicious nut butter mixed with fine chocolate, reminiscent of Nutella but with a sophisticated twist. As the beer's flavor develop on the palate toffee, caramel, molasses, char, tobacco, vanilla, and earthy notes. The double barrel created a huge complex depth to the beer with oak, bourbon, char, and caramel notes. This beer is a unique experience, a journey of flavors that keeps you returning for more.\n",
      "I was expecting this chewy mouthfeel, but it was more than that. The beer coats your tongue and palate, leaving a rich, dense finish that warms you from the inside. The body is heavy and has medium carbonation, adding to the overall luxurious mouthfeel.\n",
      "I am grateful that Grey Monday wasn't overly heavy and chewy, as I had expected. The beer's high ABV didn't make it too hot, and I loved the expressive nuttiness. The barrel aging was just right, not overpowering the other flavors. I'm not sure how they achieved this balance, where I'm not only sipping on wood. This is truly an enjoyable Stout, especially on a chilly, damp Idaho evening.\n",

      "750mL bottle, 2021 edition sent to new Society members under their new nationwide shipping policy. Very little difference from the base Black Tuesday, if I'm honest, having had regular BT many times but this being my first Grey Monday. That means it's excellent, but the hazelnut treatment is pretty muted at this point (if it was ever more prominent), yielding a slight generic nuttiness with a touch of additional sweetness. It's not Nutella, that's for sure. It also suffers the same shortcomings of the standard BT, being very thin on mouthfeel for the ultra-high ABV and pretty hot on bourbon heat once it warms up a bit.\n",
      "Pours a very dark brown though with moderate light clarity on the edges. Fizzy cola head that quickly dissipates to a thin ring. Nose has a hint of hazelnuts right off the bat before giving way to big waves of whiskey and rum, molasses, dark soy sauce, barley, oyster sauce, and vanilla. Flavor is a little tough to place. Heat - both warming booze and sharp ethanol - pop right away. There's significant salinity that's different from Black Tuesday - less deep, blackstrap molasses, more brackish sea spray or even oysters. Malts, soy sauce, black licorice are there, but with less intensity than BT. The nuts come forward as it warms, and though it's hard to definitively place hazelnuts, they would be a guess along with peanuts and hazelnuts - definitely nothing too fatty like a walnut. Mouthfeel is remarkably thin for this kind of beer (I'd call it \"moderate\"), especially when compared to BT or a BCBS. That's not bad per se, but I think the feel contributes to the overall heat and sharpness. This was interesting - though I'm not sure I'd be keen to shell out for another bottle.\n",

Ruby red pour with a small eggshell white head that eventually settle into surface islands.

Taste switches the vanilla and lemon intensities, funk is milder but now get some hay, genera supporting red fruits, and a touch of earth.

      "2020 version poured from a bottle into a snifter. This is nicely thick with a strong fudge flavor.\n",
      "From a bottle. Pours a dark rich brown color with an inch plus of thick creamy tan foam. Smells of caramel, toffee, and dark fruit; no hops. The flavor follows the smell: sweet, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, also no hops. The body is medium-light. Very quaffable.\n",

      "Overall, excellent beer.\n",
      "Finally got to try this much talked about beer last night and it definitely lived up to the hype. I've never tasted something so complex and layered. Initial impression when you open up the bottle and pour it is the striking caramel color (which might lead you into thinking it's a stout but the colour is lighter than a stout as you can notice when you hold it up against a light) along with strong aromas of spice and alcohol and hints of chocolate. It also has a nice foam that lasts for a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you first taste it you might be taken aback by how undeniably smooth it is and how well the alcohol is masked in the sip. At 11% alcohol, you might feel that it will taste of that and nothing else but you'd be wrong. Alcohol is one of the last things you'll taste in this beer. Initially you'll taste coffee and spice along with a gentle, soothing sweetness that pleasantly compliments that stringent alcohol taste and in the finish you get a nice bitterness that is generally associated with beers. But the finish is not where this beer stops testing your senses. You'll feel warmth coursing through your body as this drink makes its way to your stomach where once it reaches you'll feel more pleasant warmth, a warmth that is comparable to the one felt while feasting on a soup or a stew.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's definitely a high quality and one of a kind beer that should be tried by every person interested in beer. It's a strong and complex tasting beer that is good to drink in winters and that too every once a while. I cannot see myself drinking this every other week, this is a once a two-three month kind of beer for me, not just due to the price but also due to the fact that its so much to take in. This is the dark elixir that I imagine is drunk by royals in Game of Thrones.\n",
      "I almost never rate anything perfect because that means I can never do better. Like my lifelong beer quest is at its apex and it is all downhill from here. But having been tasting and rating beer for around forty years I can say that Rochefort 10 is the world's best beer. And that includes Westy 12. Rochefort has a certain malty thickness to it that I don't get from Westy. I just love the stuff. World's best. What else can I say beyond that?\n",
      "Too much alcohol. Astringent and bitter. It does taste of cola and chocolate. An absurd amount of head and carbonation. Overall not as good as I would expect.\n",

      "\n",
      "330 ml (11.2 oz.) bottle. Pours a dark, cola brown. In fact, it looks just like Coca-cola. Has a light-brown head that dissipates quickly. Aromas of chocolate, caramel, and raisins. Taste is, WOW! Lightly-sweet, but not overly so, with flavors of cola, plum, and another fruit that I can’t quite put my finger on. Has a medium body and texture. Carbonation is pretty lively. Finish is smooth and long with hints of brown sugar.\n",

      "\n",
      "L: The beer is hazy to the point of opaque with a light sunset yellow hue in the glass. There's a frothy, bright-white, long-lasting head. A multitude of bubbles can be seen along the edges of the glass. If not for the head, at a distance, I'd have thought I was drinking fruit juice.\n",
      "\n",
      "S: The aroma is the usual hazy pale ale tropical, slightly dank, citrus melange, with pineapple, mango and guava standing out.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: The taste, as is often the case with these beers, closely mirrors the nose, with an alcoholic fruit punch vibe. Pine, mango, and orange come to the fore, but I could pick a heap of other fruits if I thought long and hard enough. There's warmth on the way down, and given that the beer is only 5.8% ABV, I'm assuming that's the hop load talking. There's the slightest bite of shampoo in the aftertaste, but it enhances the overall experience rather than detracts.\n",
      "\n",
      "M: The mouthfeel is full and soft, like a hazy should be, and carbonation is mild and sherbety.\n",
      "\n",
      "O: This is very nice, and it's a credit to the brewer that I'm drinking it on the other side of the world eight months after I bought it, and there's still a vigorous, tropical aroma and hoppy bite on the swallow.\n",

      "Arguably the best pale ale I've had in my life. Beautiful lacing, gorgeous citrusy bouquet that leads into a very drinkable beer with pleasant mouthfeel and a wonderful hoppiness. I don't usually like hoppiness this much but this hoppiness turned into happiness for me.\n",
      "The flavors a citrus, pine resin, grapefruit with some flora hop notes. The mouthfeel has moderate to high carbonation with a medium body and clean finish. Excellent!\n",

      "My favorite “American Pale ale”\n",
      "I understand that the world thinks this is a practically perfect Citra ale - and I do not necessarily disagree, but to rate it as 99 is over-doing it a bit! First of all, this is not a pale ale, it is an NEIPA! And as that I rated it accordingly above - I couldn't rate it as a pale ale because that's not what it is. It is a lovely beer but I find that after a pint I wouldn't be able to drink more because the sweet aftertaste of the ale is somehow cloying, can't describe it any better than that.\n",
      "Not quite a clear golden color, soapy white head and some greaat lacing. Nose says fruit, citrus, maybe some mango. Nice bitter finish but smooth. Really nice beer, don't see much Surly here.\n",
      "A - Pours out a hazy copper-orange color, super fluffy off-white head, persistent, with lots of small gauge bubble lacing.\n",

      "S - Strong hit of pine and citrus in the nose, some resin and Citra-brand funk on the tail end.\n",

      "T: citrus kiss, but a rush of florality right behind it... the aftertaste is spicy, with a green bitterness that slowly swells... certainly a big malty base, with a muffin/cakey quality, but it's sodden with hop resins... vague dried pale-colored fruit (apricot, sultana) slowly creeps into the aftertaste, while the residual bitterness grows some peppery hair to it... the volume on the bitterness just keeps increasing, speakers cracking and shaking; hop artifacts emerge\n",
      "\n",
      "F: its bitter bite takes hold on the tongue, mildly intensified by the ethanol, which sets and singes (and yet cools?!) a touch near the back of the palate... its body and resins make for a silky lusciousness up front, giving way to a growing heat; soft carbonation\n",

      "I am so happy to have finally found this locally (PA) after searching for it for years. It did not disappoint. While the can is over a couple of months old, the ale still tasted very fresh. I rate it as having a NE flavor profile while having a west coast appearance. It is translucent and golden, but definitely not cloudy. The head was white and not too foamy. The aromas came in waves of sweet fruit. The flavor came in waves and it seemed each one was a different type of tropical fruit. What a fantastic drinking experience. The only downside was the $5 price tag, but that would be a bargain in a tavern.\n",

Beldns NEIPA juicy flavors with west-coast body and mouthfeel. Sort of reminds me of Half Acres IPA blends and not unlike Axe Man in many ways. I hate imperial IPAs as the alcohol and sweet malts ruin the hop flavors and IPA bitterness nearly every time. This one may be the exception. It's has big juicy orange and tropical melon/berry flavors with a resinous pine bitterness off the end. Sweet, but nicely balanced by bitterness. An imperial WCIPA that packs enough bitterness.

      "Well done Alesmith company!\n",
      "# 135, yum yum!\n",
      "Poured a beautiful black out of the can with a nice tan half-finger of head. Though next to no head retention, the tan floating ring that remains provides a beautiful contrast to the dark beer. Medium+ body, again a little sticky and syrupy. Definitely smells like a milk stout with some very muted vanilla notes. Palate follows with a balanced approach to the chocolate and vanilla. Some muted baking spices and coffee as well balance this out. Getting some lingering peanut/peanut butter on a long drawn out finish.\n",

      "Here we have yet another BA top 250 beer that I was able to pick up on my latest run to Tree House. This one eluded me for quite some time and I’m happy I was finally able to grab a 4 pack. It’s a fairly straightforward Milk Stout with basic adjuncts but Tree House tends to excel at that. Let’s dive right in\n",

      "\n",
      "While not quite as masterfully balanced in taste, this is still damn good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, light roast coffee, brown sugar, caramel, raisin, vanilla creme, dark bread, and light toffee. The swallow brings notes of black cherry, milk chocolate, medium roast coffee, vanilla creme, brown sugar, raisin, burnt caramel, and dark bread\n",

      "Taking inspiration from famous Brussel's apricot sour ale, Side Project is brewing more like pros when brewing and aging their own unique spin on the fruited gueuze style.\n",
      "\n",
      "La Fosse brings a golden tinge to an otherwise bubbly champagne pour. But the beer strikes the nose with force as the overwhelming sour scent tightens the jaws and wets the whistle with fruit, funk and fauna. A scantly sweet introduction is of light wafer, sourdough and a brief hint of taffy.\n",
      "\n",
      "But anything seeming sweet is short and succinct on the middle palate. The session quickly favors the stone fruit with a light orange, mango and peach character. Shying away from fruit rollup, the beer quickly trends vinous and winey with sharp chardonnay, bubbly dryness and a piquant spice. Its bracing acidity washes any thirst from the palate as the late taste brings an earthen tone of balsa, burlap and extended wood-age white wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Light, crisp and highly refreshing, the ale is a cleaner taste compared to more Brussels brewed versions, but this brighter, cleaner and fruitier version is just as good.\n",
      "Finally made it for a visit to Side Project and they happened to have bottles of this for on-site so got one and no regearts! Sour but not too sour and just fully of ripe, juicy apricot flavor; glad I got it!\n",

      "\n",
      "A&S: The beer's appearance is bright orange at first and moves to a muddy orange as the remaining beer and sediment are poured in. The head is fizzy and big, there is some lacing. The aroma is powerful! Chalky yeast, tart peaches, and apricots.\n",
      "\n",
      "T&M: The taste is acidic, fruity, tart, and lemony. Very clean. Cereal finish. Tartness is cleared out when the sediment is poured in and the funk comes through more than before. The high carbonation is champagne-like at first, then comes in a little more creamy later on.\n",
      "\n",

      "Hazy dull orange body, strong white head, rings of lacing. Magnificent aroma of mixed non citrus fruit which carries over into the taste. Abv well hidden, juicy, fruity, quite smooth. Finish is a lasting dance between mild bitterness and fruit. Excellent beer, which at $10.95 a pint it should be.\n",
      "Pours a very hazy mango color with a creamy white head that provides a nice amount of lacing and maintains a ring around the body as you enjoy the beer. Beautiful hazy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nose is dank and citrusy, with tart tangerine, mango, and passion fruit notes, as well as a nice bit of apricot. Full on salivating at this point.\n",

      "The taste is really led by a delightful interplay between the mango, apricot, and tart tangerine flavors equally delicious and accompanied by a bit of passion fruit. World class stuff here, IMHO.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mouthfeel is medium and surprisingly lively for a hazy. Tree House rightfully gets loads of attention in the beer nerd world, but Trillium is every bit their equal, IMHO.\n",
      "I cannot add any more that others havent mentioned. The mouthfeel is just so smooth that I wish I had this locally. As good of a hazy as I have ever had. Worth it for the mouthfeel alone.\n",

      "T: Plenty of ripe tropical and stone fruit, pineapple, passion fruit, peach, apricot, mango, cantaloupe, and a hint of guava, juicy citrus, tangerine, lemon, and grapefruit, a little pine, resinous green grassy notes, a touch of spice, a little earthy slightly herbal undertone, biscuity malt, and caramel sweetness.\n",

      "M: A touch on the fuller side of medium body, slightly prickly moderate carbonation, yet creamy smooth.\n",
      "\n",
      "O: I had this one for the first time last year and was so utterly underwhelmed that I figured it was an off batch or something must have happened to it in transit. No way could my experience be so far off from such a normally highly regarded beer, so I vowed to give it a second chance as soon as I saw it again.\n",
      "Really glad I decided to give it another chance, this can is completely different experience and much more along the lines of what everyone else has said about it. There's still a bit of a herbal earthy tone that I'm not in love with that is holding me back from scoring it higher, but it is significantly less pronounced than it was in my previous can.\n",
      "My overall impression: They pulled just about everything there is to pull from Mosaic hops and paired it with a ridiculously smooth malt base. I wouldn't mind the earthy herbal side being minimized a bit more, but I'd happily buy this one again.\n",
      "Received this amazing beer from Der WunderLlama in NBW BIF 18.\n",
      "Poured like liquid black, with viscosity and heft. The brown bubbles that formed at the edges did manage to cover the surface for a moment or two. Then they just went away, leaving nothing but blackness in the glass.\n",
      "The taste, just wow. I had a flash of the bourbon in the first sip or two but after that it retreated to the shadows. Coffee is present, but the star of this is the chocolate. Amped up by the vanilla, the chocolate manages to give the impression of chocolate lava cake, or at least the lava part. Yet somehow it isn’t very sweet. How that is possible is beyond me.\n",
      "The feel is darned near chewy - it has HEFT. It seems to need all that body to carry all those flavors.\n",
      "Exceptional beer.\n",

      "This is the last new beer from my recent trip up to Tree House. I was very excited to see this on the menu when I went, as it’s one of the last remaining Tree House beers in the BA top 250 that I haven’t tried yet. That being said, I’m not the biggest fan of just vanilla in a Stout, but I trust that they’ve got it figured out. Let’s dive right in\n",

      "\n",
      "The nose is damn nice here, the vanilla contributes a lot of different notes but it's still a bit subdued. I'm picking up on aromas of vanilla bean, jammy blackberry, molasses, milk chocolate, sweet bourbon, toasted oak, red grape, burnt sugar, and light caramel\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh yeah, it opens up much more in taste, very complex but so easy to enjoy. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting chocolate fudge, vanilla bean, molasses, toasted oak, brown sugar, red grape, caramel candy, sweet bourbon, jammy blueberry, and light honey. The swallow brings notes of vanilla bean, earthy bourbon, milk chocolate, jammy blueberry, burnt sugar, red grape, caramel, charred oak, and spent coffee beans\n",

      "A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a rich beer. Finishes a tad sticky but dries out over time\n",
      "\n",
      "This one took me by surprise. Of all the big Stouts I've had from Tree House, this one isn't as sweet as the others tend to be. It's got a great evolution to it unlike similar beers\n",
      "This one is very similar to regular Truth -- a thick, sweet, fudgy stout with a just enough bourbon barrel character to cut through the immensity of the base beer -- but with the added benefit of copious vanilla character that adds even more dessert-like complexity into the mix. It's sort of a mashup between vanilla cake and super dense dark chocolate brownies. The balance of intense velevety viscocity while not being cloyingly sweet is really what makes this (and the other Truth variants) shine.\n",
      "Liked this a bit more than the galaxy version - both pale in comparison to the DDH version, but this was really solid. A little more dank than the other two versions, but that's A-OK with me. Medium body, a little heavier than what I'd classify as an \"easy drinker,\" however these are perfect for a day at the pool, or cracking on a hot muggy day. Good to great beer - you won't be disappointed in this one.\n",

      "Pours a slightly hazy, golden honey color; fairly dense, slow-rising carbonation; thick, white head, dense and billowy. Incredible nose of mild green apple and dry Riesling wine; ripe pear; foeder wood; barest hint of barnyard funk. Sweet apple cider and white wine taste; pear and a nebulous sense of citrus like lemon and tangerine; mild to moderately acidic taste; little (if any) bitterness; faint hint of wooden barrel tones. Medium-heavy mouthfeel; moderately prickly on the palate; semi-juicy and acidic feel.\n",
      "\n",

Sweet, champagne-like cider notes up front that is confronted by some sharp acidity. It is, overall, the right amount of acidity with the acidity presented in a very nice way. This is really nice, as advertised.\n",

      "750 ml bottle poured into a red wine glass (not all at once!). 2018 vintage, best by 2038. I've had this bottle since 2020 and figured it would be better not to wait too long to drink, in case the fruit fades over the years. Pours a clear pink color (at least until reaching the plentiful sediment lower in the bottle) with a quickly fading head. Aroma and flavor feature bracing acidity, sharp oak tannins, leather funk, background malt, no hops to speak of, and a surprising amount of bright raspberry flavor. Very low carbonation, maybe 10-15% of most beers, giving it almost but not quite a flat mouthfeel. It took a few sips to get used to but didn't detract too much from the overall enjoyment. Overall it's not for the faint of heart, and for fans of the style, this is a stellar beer. Great stuff.\n",

      "\n",
      "With the initial flavor the sour aspects from the lambic hit hard. There is a lot of sour cherry there. There are vinegar overtones that accent the sour flavor. The sour raspberry comes through for the finish and the sour fades temporarily and fresh fruity and juicy raspberry comes through along with a woodieness from the barrel. Left to linger long is a little bit of everything I just described.\n",
      "\n",
      "The feel is somewhat thin and vineagary. The carbonation is present but very soft which is welcoming considering the consistency of the liquid and the sour punch the flavor packs.\n",

      "T: Oh boy, that sweet tart berry/cherry mix is there. Which becomes super acidic and sour. That funk, light oak and vanilla is there as well. Which tries to help balance. Though that acidic sourness becomes a little to much and makes this unbalanced for me.\n",
      "M/O: A medium body that has a nice crisp bite. Really well carbonated. Definitely some sweetness as would be expected, but finishes with a dry bite as well. Pretty classic for the style, but still its slow going. That acidity takes over to much.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love 3 Fonteinen, and this is a good example of the style for sure. Though it is unbalanced for me. There are other Fruit Lambic's that I prefer over this, but still you have to acknowledge that this is exactly what they wanted to make, and I do enjoy it. Just not love it as much as others in the style, or even others from this same brewery. I would recommend this, if you enjoy intense flavors, especially sour acidic cherries.\n",
      "B1. Almost definitely past prime. Very tart and acetic and not much nectarine character left\n",
      "Yellow gold in color with a murky complexion. The aroma is of fresh nectarines and lactobacillius. I'm tasting fresh nectarine juice and lactobacillius, which on a day with a 100+ heat index is very refreshing. The mouth is crisp and moderately carbonated.\n",

Beer opens white vinegar, old stone fruit pit, and dried plum. Foam, wet wood, and apricot pit towards the end. Cobwebs, hay, and a tart funk at the finish. Body is light with ample carbonation. Prickly on the palate and goes down lively with a long aftertaste.\n",
      "Appearance - The beer was an orange, yellow color with visible carbonation and a half inch of head.\n",

      "The pour that emptied a pint can's contents into a clear glass liter mug produced that nearly stark white foam that bears witness to a wheat inclusion. The foam recedes unevenly, unattractively and in this case, slowly. The body is dull apricot-amber, approaching murky. In short, it looks like the typical modern American IPA. Thankfully, it smells much better than it looks. There's at least a sharp citrus/pine noting to the hops. A malty counterbalance, not so much. The description of the taste is basically a repeat of the words used for the smell. The 9% ABV is noticed, as it adds to the hop bite, but not as a detriment. Also, there's a little more starchy sweetness than predicted by the nose, but it's shallow. Taste references would be pineapple and lemon, backed by a good earthy hop bite. The mouthfeel is average for the style, maybe just a little better for something that carries this much alcohol. There's some stratified glass lacing that enhances its looks. Overall, for something that obviously has wheat in its wort, this isn't bad, especially for one that hits with such potency.\n",

While buying I was told that this is one of their blends that is from lambic brewed fully in-house, as opposed to some of their \"less special\" blends including some lambic from other breweries nearby. This specific blend has up to four-year old lambic at the time of bottling and the final blend comes from four different barrels and six different beers. As expected, this is difficult to describe. So complex. So much going on. Also quite strong. The yeast, the funk, the acidity, the near fruit-like qualities. This is lambic taken to another level. Obviously a world-class blend.\n",

One thick ring of lacing remained near the top of my pint glass a there were enough scattered suds the rest of the way down. Lots of tangy citrus, white grape, and dank hops in the nose as the taste was just as smooth as the mellow aroma was inviting.

      "Mouthfeel is creamy, rich, smooth, but nowhere near heavy. Overall, this is an excellent beer.\n",
      "Cola black with a thin mocha head that quickly settles into a crown. Dark malt, licorice and marshmallow in the nose. Similar taste with some slight nuttiness and leather behind. A hint cinnamon-like wood in there, too. Thin feel with tight, soft fizz. Quality brew, but not a wow beer. (2023 version.)\n",
      "Very good head production and decent retention, given the ABV and barrel treatment. After settling into the glass, it retains a lovely thin but noticeable dark brown ring of foam.\n",

      "Nose prominently features bourbon and oak, but not at the expense of the rich, roasty malt base. Notes of chocolate, red grape, prune, vanilla, honeycomb, molasses, coffee, and a touch of anise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite creamy on the palate, more than usual for a milk stout. The cream and vanilla notes blend harmoniously with the sweet bourbon profile, likely leading to that unusually strong character. Roastiness is present but not over the top. Impressively smooth, both in flavor and mouthfeel. Additional tasting notes of toast, light coffee, red grape, and semi-sweet chocolate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Supremely smooth BBA imperial (milk) stout, but it reminds me quite a bit of Dragon's Milk (but smoother). The creaminess borders on cloying, if not quite reaching that point; the bourbon is fairly simple and straightforward; the malt base could use a bit more oomph.\n",

      "Very tasty beer, but for one generally considered a bit of a legend, I'm a little let down.\n",

      "Aroma is malt forward with milk chocolate, vanilla, brown sugar and a good whiff of bourbon note. No warm or fusol alcohol more of the sweet side of bourbon. Also no hop presence here at all on the nose.\n",
      "First sip reveals a very smooth textured medium bodied beer with fine soft and gentle carbonation. The carb is very fine and gentle, which all makes for a velvety smooth physical experience.\n",
      "Flavor is what the nose advertises, with sweet chocolate, brown sugar and some vanilla, all giving way to bourbon notes and a little warming on the swallow. Bourbon flavor lingers and also coats my lips. I do get a little bit of a coffee note in the back of each swallow too. Again, no hops to be found.\n",

      "Bourbon up front in the nose, along with milk chocolate and coffee notes, pretty much in that order.\n",
      "\n",
      "More complex in the taste than in the nose. Still bourbon-y up front, and with a milk chocolatey sweetness, but there's also a bit of tobacco and dark fruit to the flavor. It all melds together very, very well.\n",

Heavy body; dense and silky on the palate; very muted boozy warmth.\n",

      "Impermanence has a deep, rich, and opaque black color. It has a creamy, dense, and long-lasting head of tan foam that leaves attractive lacing on the glass. Impermanence is rich and complex, with a strong presence of dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and a hint of dark fruit. The coffee notes are bold and robust, chocolate adds a smooth sweetness that balances out the bitterness from the roasted malts. The dark fruit notes are subtle, but add an extra layer of depth and complexity to the aroma. Overall, the aroma of the Impermanence Stout is truly captivating and leaves you eager to take a sip. On the palate, Impermanence has a rich, full-bodied flavor profile that is both complex and satisfying. The initial taste is a strong, bitter espresso-like flavor, which is quickly followed by notes of dark chocolate and roasted malt. This is balanced out by a hint of sweetness from the malt. Impermanence has a creamy and silky mouthfeel that makes it a pleasure to drink. The texture is thick and smooth, coating the palate. The body is medium to full, providing a substantial and satisfying experience with each sip. The carbonation is low, giving the stout a smooth and creamy finish without being too fizzy. Overall, the mouthfeel of this stout is well-balanced and luxurious. Overall, Tree House Brewing Impermanence is an outstanding stout! With its rich flavor, smooth finish, and attractive appearance, it is sure to be a hit with anyone who tries it.\n",

      "Very strong aroma. Bourbon first, then barrel. Molasses. Slight hint of vanilla.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rich flavor, mirroring the aroma. Bourbon, oak, vanilla, sweet molasses. Adding to the party is roasted malts and dark fruits. Toward the finish and into the aftertaste, dark chocolate appears along with the alcohol, slightly warming my mouth in the after. The finish is sweet vanilla and dark chocolate.\n",

A rich aroma and flavor, a substantial body, lots of bourbon and barrel without overpowering the underlying Imperial stout flavors, a sweet, but controlled sweetness, finish. It's not a dessert beer, but an excellent evening sipping beer. If I'm feeling like splurging, I may actually buy it again!\n",
      "REview#1600,This thing is all barrel, but that's not a bad thing in this case. If I had to say something bad about it I would say it is sorta harsh and abrasive at times, overpowering and (this sounds dumb) kinda too smooth at other times... unbeer-like if that makes sense, tastes like some sort of new better drink that supersedes beer into a more betterer territory\n",

      "Pours jet black. Aroma is coffee, chocolate fudge, salted caramel, and some slight booze. There is a touch of earthiness from the peppers but it's subtle. Taste follows suit. Alcohol well hidden for the abv. Rich and delicious. This just doesn't look great in a glass and the touch of booze on the aroma is knocking this down a bit.\n",

      "\n",
      "Pours pitch black with a small, wispy toffee colored head. Sporadic lacing. Aroma is coffee and chocolate and figs and alcohol. Mouthfeel is a little thin for my liking.

      "Feel: rich, silky, velvety, and smooth. Low carbonation as expected given the style and the 13% abv. Warmth from the alcohol during and after swallow. Tingling spice on the tongue (from the chile peppers) long after the swallow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall: one of the best - and possibly THE best - adjunct imperial stout I have ever had the fortune of trying. Exquisitely well-balanced flavors.\n",
      "This one is rich, dark and creamy. I taste all the flavors except the heat from the chiles. Maybe since it's a year old the chiles have subsided. Still a fantastic brew.\n",

      "\n",
      "Taste: Wow, the taste just doubles down on the nose. Starts off with a slowly building black currant note that is joined by a range of berry-led fruit, Cabernet, and dark cherry and peaks as layers of Brett yeast come to the forefront. Tobacco, leather, oak, and wood tannings take over and the fruity and earthy interplay is extremely dialed in with both components, complimenting rather than combatting each other. The light chocolate and tobacco hold through and lay the groundwork for what is a sour and spritzy finish, while still continuing to be smooth. No ethanol is detectable\n",

      "Overall: This is one exquisite beer. This is my first ever Russian River Wild Ale and one I’ve been wanting to try for over 15 years so finally ponied up for it and damn, it blew my hyped expectations out of the water. A delicious concoction that really sets the bar high for Wild Ales as it incorporates so much depth and subtly into each sip and comes together effortlessly. My big-time praise to RR for this gem and glad I finally experienced this legend-of-a-beer\n",

      "An extremely complex beer. Had the pleasure of drinking this at Iron Abby in Horsham PA. A fruity plum on the nose. I can taster the plum as well as some notes you will find in a Cabernet such as tobacco with a sour and dry finish.\n",
      "Served from a tap in a clear pint glass, it's modest biege head didn't last long. The brew is a deep brown-amber, almost mahogany, bright and surprisingly clear for all the color. The only aroma is that almost woody sourness common to good barrel aged ales. The barrel tannins dominate even the Brettanomyces and currants to taste. no minor feat. Yet, the taste is complex enough that they can be specifically detected. There are too many sours that are really some degree of tart. This is also a little tart, but it's unmistakably sour. The woody tannins linger a little too long in the aftertaste. Other than that, there's no complaint here. The high ABV isn't noticed, the taste is full and complex, delivered within a body that's rich for the style.\n",

      "The beer was an absolutely gorgeous, crystal clear ruby color in the bottle and appeared the same way in the glass. A short-lived, bubbly, light pink cap of froth topped the liquid, but it quickly dissolved. Spotty lacing trickled down the glass after the first few sips.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aroma was impressive and very tropical fruit forward. Dank, musty guava notes came through strongest. Lots of overripe mango as well. Touch of passionfruit. The tropical fruit qualities were very reminiscent of those one might find in an IPA. Slightly wheaty. Some tart lime was also detectable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flavor profile was solid but more sour and acidic than I anticipated. Bit of dry, crackery malts and tartness up front before the fruitiness kicked in. Lemon notes came through strongest and were well matched by a lush, berry-like quality. Slightly wheaty. Touch of passionfruit. I definitely would not pick out the dragon fruit, though I am not very familiar with dragon fruit flavor. More lemony tartness on the back end. A lemon rind-like bitterness lingered after the swallow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent prickly, finely beaded mouthfeel. Medium bodied for the style. The carbonation gave the beer a light and soft fluffiness on the palate.\n",
      "\n",
      "DFPF (whatever that means) is an enjoyable and refreshing Berliner Weisse with nice fruity notes, although I definitely did not pick up much passionfruit or dragonfruit specifically. I am glad I had the opportunity to finally try this beer but, at $25 a bottle, probably would not purchase it again.\n",
      "Pinkish magenta cloudy body with a pinkish cap. Tart and sweet passionfruit in a good berliner with notes of cracker, lemon, wheat and salt in both smell and taste. Feel is very tart and decently acidic, but it doesn't lose the script with wheat and salt making impacts. Fun and regional emphasis, refreshing even, not the most complex but it delivers what is promised\n",

      "\n",
      "Oh no, I stand corrected, that is much better in taste. Nicely tart and well balanced. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting passion fruit, underripe mango, lemon juice, apricot gummy, straw, apple cider vinegar, dragonfruit, and tart cherry.

      "Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a very hazy, medium dull gold with a fine three finger white head with great retention and nice lacing. Aroma of pale malt, citrus and tropical fruit hops, lemon, grapefruit, green melon, mixed tropical fruit. Flavor is pale malt, citrus and mixed fruit hops, orange, grapefruit, mild pine, vague mixed fruit; pine resin developing into the finish but with only moderate bitterness; a little dankness in the aftertaste. Medium bodied with moderate creaminess. I picked this up, knowing it was a New England style IPA, because it is listed as Trillium's flagship American IPA. Sadly, it is in the category of mild bitterness NE style, which are not to taste. The aroma was OK, but the taste seemed subdued and muddled, with some citrus and pine, but otherwise unidentifiable juice notes that remind me of fruit juice that has set out for a while. I keep trying this style, particularly well received ones and every once in a while I find a nicely bitter one with some bright defined flavors; this was not one of them. It's satisfactory and I do appreciate the sometimes intense hop notes in these, but they seem vague to me. I see I did like Bake and Break from these guys, so I'll watch for another promising one.\n",

      "2021 vintage. Pours a dark brown with lots of flecks of ruby red as the light hits it; pours rather thin with a fizzy cola head that disappears quickly. Bits of carb hitting the surface. No lacing/retention. Nose is roasted coffee beans, molasses, black licorice, loose change, baking chocolate. Very little barrel character, at least initially. Kind of mind-blowing these days to have a chocolate and coffee stout that doesn't lay it on thick with raw adjunct aromas; while the coffee and chocolate are certainly there, they feel like parts of a whole that developed together, rather than some gunk that's thrown in and overpowers the product. Taste follows a similar vein - big coffee roasted coffee bean notes throughout the palate. Through its very long finish, dark chocolate and dark fruit, vanilla, smoky wood, salty black licorice, and finally, traces of warming, spicy bourbon emerge. As on the smell, a really impressive use of the adjuncts here - not at all overpowering, but still present throughout. Mouthfeel is the only real knock for me. The feel is surprisingly thin, and I think a little more body would be nice (and even expected?) given the ABV. Really worth seeking out.\n",

      "750 ml bottle, 2021 vintage, bottled 10/21/21, label says 19.1% ABV. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with not quite an inch tan head that fizzled away kinda quickly but leaves a small bit of head. Small amount of lacing. I like the aroma, the brew smells like bourbon, coffee, vanilla, cacao nibs and roasted malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some oak and fudge flavors noticeable too. Good amount of barrel character in both the taste and aroma. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick, rich and a bit creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation. I thought this was a pretty good brew, definitely worth picking up if you're into big barrel aged coffee stouts!\n",

      "S- bold and rich herbal and earthy espresso notes initially, followed by dark chocolate, brownie batter and a blast of cinnamon. Undertones of the maple pop through, adding aromas of caramel and dark fruit. Light oak and creamy vanilla close out the nose, with more espresso and cinnamon sticking around, very inviting\n",
      "\n",
      "T- bold espresso and dark chocolate brownie batter up front make for a perfect opening. Mid-palate brings out plenty of barrel, adding spicy cinnamon, oak & barrel juice. The sweet maple starts to pop out under the cinnamon whiskey, along with a creamy vanilla note to compliment. The finish gives more cinnamon & dark chocolate with a strong espresso and mocha linger\n",

      "M- medium body with moderate-low carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that turns slightly creamy into a warming finish\n",
