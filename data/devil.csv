A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.93,"Batch 11 - 2023 (black wax) - just a superb beer. Pours a deep, dark brown color with an amazing nose of barrel and caramel / sweetness. Taste hits you with perfect balance; that's what sets this apart - it's as if the entire beer plays nice with all of its parts, intense flavors of barrel, sweetness, raisin and caramel, complimented by dark fruit and brown sugar.
I might say it's a smidge thin for me, but that's if I'm TRYING to find a flaw. It's the embodiment of a perfect BA barleywine, IMO. Right up there with MJK and 10 Yr BW from SP. I think 10 Yr BW edges this out by the narrowest of margins, but let's be honest, I'm not turning either down given the chance to have it again. What a beverage. One of those beers that you were almost pissed that you decided to split it instead of solo-doming. :)"
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.86,"Briljant beer and worth searching for.
In the nose - a really nice and complex smell that longs for another sniff.
Taste- complex, sweet but not overwhelming, caramel, tannins and vanilla from the barrel.
Overall- excellent flavor and taste, not unbalanced in anyway."
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.73,"Thank you to noblepudding, a prince among traders, for sending this fancy, gold-waxed bottle to the northern steppes. 375ML, Batch #7.

The pour is a muddied brown-red with the expected lack of bubbles. The nose is a sharp spike of bourbon & booze.

A Deal with the Devil â€“ Triple Oaked is a multi-layered beast. The booze is off the charts for a malt-based product & the bourbon exhale is spectacular; if I drank the stuff I suspect I could pull some of the various bottles out of the layers. Underneath that glorious noise is black, bruised, sweet fruit just on the edge of gone, molasses, achingly sweet, before the desiccated oak brings it home. Shame this bottle is so small. I have lots of sick/vacation time to use on three of these in a night.

Well, damn. Anchorage rarely misses on their big bottles & they better not based on the price point. This is transcendent."
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.87,"Pours a deep, dark brown color. Aroma is an amazing, complex combination of dark fruits, oak, bourbon with hints of caramel and a tad bit of coconut. Taste follows nose but with more intensity of flavor and sweetness -- the dark fruits (fig and plums), brown sugar, caramel, bourbon and the oak. So very balance and very present in the taste without distracting from the other flavors. Full bodied, traditional ADWTD mouthfeel. Incredible barleywine and worth the wait."
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.6,"2021 batch 3, drank in June 2022. Didn't get as much from this as previous ADWTD. Felt sweet without complexity that you would expect. Still very delicious, just not worth the price."
