Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,4.61,"Sampled at the brewery, this is the 2022 bottle version.

The beer pours a viscous, blackish brown color with light brownish lacing and good head retention. This beer pours like motor oil, and has the look of a beer that has seen some serious barrel aging (which I assume it has). The nose is rich and decadent, showcasing maple syrup, dark chocolate, chocolate brownie, vanilla, light coffee and noticeable bourbon. This smells like it might be pretty good, albeit very sweet and rich. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, with the maple syrup, vanilla and bourbon taking center stage. This beer is very sweet with quite a bit of maple flavor, which is perhaps its only flaw. Mouthfeel is very full, with a long, soft finish. The beer comes across as very viscous on the palate. Carbonation is fairly low, which I think works well with the mouthfeel in this beer. The finish in this beer goes on forever. Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile, though the abv is actually relatively low for a ba stout these days. In any event, while you can tell the abv is up there in this beer, there's no heat or off flavors from the alcohol.

Obviously, this is an excellent BA impy stout. Does is justify the hype and price tag? Can't answer that. Depends on the consumer I suppose. All I'll say is that it's a a very good beer and one I'm happy to have tried."
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,4.71,"The perfect barrel aged stout. Not overly sweet, nice barrel notes with coffee and maple. Just delish!"
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,5.0,"The flirtation with maple comes to a crescendo in Toppling Goliath's imperial maple, coffee and bourbon barrel aged stout.

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout shows that something special is up when it pours with an inky impression of black brandy equipped with sticky legging swirling around an ominously still beer. As a sultry, savory and oh-so seductive scent pulls from the onyx-black beer, the mouth waters with the scent of espresso, dark chocolate, maple, sweet bourbon and port wine. Expectedly sweet, the toasty malts bring out the flavor of maple-dipped chocolate, chocolate covered espresso bean, bourbon ball candies and whisky laced molasses.

Bold, savory, sweet and mouth coating on the middle palate, the boldness of the stout remains in check while the more roasty edges pull from the sweetness with espresso roast, toasty, smoky and baker's chocolate that all trend spicy, lightly bitter and balancing with a chest warming offset of bourbon and all of its caramel, vanilla, toasted oak and peppery whisky flavors in closure.

Obviously full, rich and lavishly malted from start to finish, the stout finishes on a drying track in an off-pastry mouthfeel of spice, light bitterness and port-like warmth. It's a masterful stout that belongs on such lofty pedestals."

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,4.98,"On tap at TG for part of KBBS release day - rating 2023 version; perfect black color. This is an amazing blend richness, dessert and coffee; the barrel is perfectly complimentary and not overpowering. The sweetness is palatable rather than making your teeth hurt. The mouthfeel is thick and silky. Overall, one of the best beers I've had."
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,4.7,"Perfect black color. I didn't see much foam, other than a brown ring. The smell is a perfect blend of maple, coffee, chocolate, and bourbon. The taste is strong with maple. Almost too strong. Chocolate follows, with coffee, bourbon, and vanilla. It is very sweet. The mouthfeel is thick, smooth, lucious, and full. Very nice. Overall, this is a wonderful beer, but there is too much maple flavor for it to be one of my favorite beers."
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,5.0,"Amazing stout, expensive but worth the price!"
O.W.K.,5.0,Amazing
O.W.K.,4.75,"Cellared 5 years. Pitch black oily pour, no head. Let's start with the mouthfeel because it is basically perfect: rich full body with silk smoothness, booze warmth is at the perfect level, dark wood, mild roast, and rye all come together to help shape a complex beauty. Tastes of rich chocolate fudge, black strap molasses, leather, caramel, vanilla, earth, char, roasted malt, prune, complex barrel, finishing complex wood. Smell is more barrel forward with chocolate, char and vanilla as the leading complimentary emphases. Complex, deep, rich, and refined. Really impressed as this exceeds the hype for me, excited to compare with the 2023 bottle I have"
Vanilla Bean Assassin,1.25,Have you ever been jumped at a beer in southeast ATL? If you haven’t this beer is prefect for you! It’s like an all out assault on your taste buds.
Vanilla Bean Assassin,5.0,Had 2019 and 2022. Both were fantastic vanilla came out perfectly. This beer has a great thickness and lives up to the hype. 2019 was more thick but both were anazing.
Vanilla Bean Assassin,4.74,"Black thick appearance with no head, barely even a collar, no lacing. Whiskey barrel mellowed nicely by vanilla a la marshmallows, milk chocolate, and latte. Moderate to thick body, light carbonation. Delicious!"

Vanilla Bean Assassin,4.55,"2022 vintage

How does one follow up review #1000 with the #1 highest rated beer on BA? Review #200 being the #2 highest rated beer of course! I’m very excited for another massive milestone review beer, and I couldn’t think of a better way to celebrate it than with this legendary beer. Let’s pop this bad boy open and find out what it’s all about

Pours completely pitch black with a finger of frothy light tan head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing

There’s just a massive punch of vanilla in the nose, and while there’s also a nice fruitiness it’s not all that complex. I’m picking up on aromas of vanilla bean, red grape, milk chocolate, toasted oak, jammy blackberry, molasses, sweet bourbon, burnt caramel, and brown sugar

It’s has more of an evolution to it in taste, and it is so damn tasty. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting chocolate fudge, sweet bourbon, vanilla bean, jammy blackberry, raisin, toasted oak, fruity coffee, burnt caramel, molasses, and light walnut. The swallow brings notes of vanilla extract, red grape, brown sugar, charred oak, sweet bourbon, molasses, jammy blackberry, burnt caramel, chocolate fudge, light fig, and marshmallow

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes a tad sticky but it doesn’t hurt the drinkability

This beer is absolutely worthy of this milestone review. The aroma had me a bit concerned it would be simplistic despite it being good, but it’s so much more than just vanilla. Great stuff!"
Marshmallow Handjee,4.63,"Draft at Hops and Pie’s Dark Lord Day 2024 in Denver.

Better than expected. Very smooth. Light vanilla. Sweet but not cloying. I had an 8oz pour and it was perfect."
Marshmallow Handjee,4.84,2021 Vintage - from my untappd on 12/11/2021: So glad I finally got to try this one. Worth the hype a hundred times over.
Marshmallow Handjee,5.0,OMG!! One of the finest elixirs I’ve ever tasted. The 15% is non existent. The vanilla is in your face. The base beer is phenomenal. Truly a transcendent experience. Wow!!

Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,4.78,"Man is this brew good...I've been wanting to try this for years. Ever since I had original Abraxas back in 2020, I've been pining to get my hands on this bottle.

As for looks, its your standard fare for a 14% Stout. Dark and thick looking with little to no foam to speak of. Some legs on the side of the glass, but it doesn't look too sticky appearance wise.

Nose is freaking superb. Oak, chocolate, cinnamon, bourbon, roasted malt that typically reminds me of street cart style pretzel, dark fruit like fig as it warms. Very mild ethanol presence which is crazy all things considered.

Taste is nearly as good as the nose. The roasted malt, chocolate, and cinnamon come together in a decadent fashion. Like malted milk ball and cinnamon ice cream, but not as sweet. I think the peppers have been hidden by the barrel aging. They manifest as heat on the back of the throat, but not so much as flavor. The slight issue I have with this is the astringency from the barrel aging. Sometimes the barrel, the roasted malt, and the ethanol come together and create an almost soapy taste and feel. It's very silght but it still exists on the mid palate where you want the flavors to crescendo a little more harmoniously.

Mouthfeel is great as well. Thick, smooth, silky, and almost fluffy. Not too cloying or oily. Some of that tannin astringency emerges as well, but not offensive. Very mild alcohol burn.

Yeah, this is the real deal. Pretty much as close to perfection as a brew can get. I don't believe in an objective perfect beer, because if you strengthen one aspect you might inevitably weaken another. But this one shows true skill and care in mastering a craft.
Rated #5 on this website for a reason."
Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,4.54,Newbies share 2024. I prefered the 2022 to the 2024. Mellowed out on the booze a little bit. Pepper was very nice in both and the vanilla mixed with cinnamon was very well done as well. Would happily revisit.
Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,4.84,"Pours a rich, deep dark brown. Aroma is wonderfully sweet & intense. Equal notes of chocolate, vanilla, bourbon and chilis with some cinnamon and caramel. Taste follows and is even more pleasing than aroma. Plenty of enjoyable and well balanced flavors -- chocolate (fudge), chilis, vanilla, caramel, toffee & plenty of cinnamon. Full bodied. One of best stouts."
Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,4.49,"2024 vintage

Review 2200. Another milestone calls for yet another infamous beer. I had the base beer a few years back and thought it was damn good, but this one is supposed to be so much better. How much better? The base beer is currently sitting at #244 overall on BA and this barrel aged variant sits at a whopping #5 overall. Alright, let’s dive right into this beast

Pours completely pitch black with a finger of creamy dark tan head that fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing

Surprisingly this is rather gentle in the nose. I expected more of a bite between the adjuncts and barrel aging but I really like this approach. I'm picking up on aromas of cacao nib, molasses, sweet bourbon, vanilla bean, dried chili, red grape, toasted oak, maple syrup, and light cinnamon

There's more bite to it in taste but it never becomes overwhelming, it's very nicely balanced. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting cacao nib, chili powder, earthy cinnamon, vanilla bean, raisin, smooth oak, burnt caramel, earthy bourbon, light molasses, and cherry pit. The swallow brings notes of cacao nib, vanilla bean, chili powder, earthy cinnamon, charred oak, chocolate fudge, cherry pit, red grape, earthy bourbon, light maple syrup, and walnut

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a chewy beer. Finishes mostly dry and drinks below its abv

Ironically, this ended up getting the same exact score from me as the base beer. Trying them side by side might be a different story, but I just wasn't blown away by this. Great, but not world class"
Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,5.0,"Now as an American site , with a majority American participation, I've always considered there to be some bias towards US brews . Not a criticism, it's natural, although I'm pleased to see the likes of Budweiser accurately assessed ! .
So an American friend meets up with me in Thailand and he's bought along this Abraxas American Imperial Stout
We sit on the balcony of my condo, and I take a sip .
I thought only we English ( eg , Courage Russian Imperial) and the Belgians could produce anything like this .
Wow , just wow .
The ratings are totally accurate, this is a masterpiece , a stunning achievement by the Perennial Artisan Ales company
Well done"
M.J.K.,4.94,"Wow, I stumbled into Side Project and they were offering 1oz, $6 pours of M.J.K. I ordered a 4oz pour. To say the beer is fantastic is an understatement.
Look: Deep amber similar to Dark Brandy
Smell: Dark fruit, toffee and booze. Amazing sweet smell lingers on the nose.
Taste: Taste is off the charts, toffee, dark fruit, not too boozy or sweet. Perfection!
Feel: Medium thickness, velvety on the tongue.
Overall: This is hands down the best Barley-wine, and one of the best beers I've ever had. For me, Side Project is only a four hour drive to St. Louis. I would have no trouble making it a regular monthly destination."

M.J.K.,4.53,"Insanely good for the style. Fantastic blend of bourbon barrels, with some barleywine sweetness and dark fruit. Deep, dark ruby-copper brown with no head, and not much carbonation."
M.J.K.,4.7,"A special gift for a special moment. This did not disappoint. The darkest brown can be, brown ring. Aromas of caramel, toffee, molasses, raisin, and bourbon explode off this one, dark oak, char, leather, barley dry earth, and a touch of cocoa and anise in the background, incredibly complex. Taste has more barrel focus with the rustic wood, bourbon, earthy char and chocolate all rise to meet the level of the toffee and dark fruit, with toasted caramel, barley, and leather support. Feel is massive and heavy, also very warm but never hot, leans more malty than barley."
M.J.K.,5.0,Absolute phenomenal brew. Super complex. Perfect in every way. It was the star of our beercation to Side Project.
Blessed,4.85,"Appearance - The beer was silky black with a reddish-tan head topping the glass.

Smell - The nose was like boozy chocolate with notes of dark fruits. The barrel was also obvious in the nose.

Taste - Initially, big slick chocolate notes cover the tongue. There was a lot of cherry and coconut with a little boozy vanilla. It drank like a port, better with small warming sips. There was a hot burn that did not take away from the profile.

Mouthfeel - The body was thick like a port, though there was carbonation.

Overall - This was hype-worthy."
Blessed,4.62,"1000th review! Yay! Finally joining the 4-digit club. I wanted to do something special for my 1000th review so I picked a special beer (I hope) and I waited for this special moment.

My first review on this website was 04/17/09 (almost exactly 15 years ago), while in college at Michigan State University, which seems like a lifetime ago. I have changed a lot, but this website and reviewing beers have been one consistency. Reviewing and rating beers has been an amazing pastime that has connected me with new friends and experiences.

Speaking of change. I have been intentionally saving this beer for my first child’s birth. It seems very silly to mark a MUCH, MUCH more important, special, magical occasion (the birth of a child) with an occasion like a 1000th beer review. However, I wanted to get a special beer to toast him with everything coinciding perfectly, even the name of the beer is perfect.

With that said, I would like to dedicate this review to you Harrison. I loved you with all my heart even before I met you.

Consumed 04/20/24, bought at San Diego Beer and Wine Company. 70$ for 12.75oz, probably the most expensive beer I have ever purchased. As always Anchorage’s label art is insanely cool. This is the 2022 variation (black and yellow label with black wax), 15.5% ABV. The description states this beer has been aged for 19 months in Woodford, Heaven Hill, and Willet barrels, then finished with Madagascar vanilla beans and raw/toasted coconuts.

Drinking this beer with a buddy with the different variant. paired with pistachios. I left it out for ~40 mins before cracking.

A&S: Jet black beer. Pretty good crack when opening, which is surprising considering the amount of aging this beer has undergone. The chocolate-colored fizzy head disappears right after pouring. The most interesting/unique characteristic of the appearance of this beer is the legs. The legs create brown oily streaks on the glass, unlike any beer I have seen. Black chunks of sediment settle on the bottle of the glass. The aroma is powerful right off the bat. My wife and mother (both novel beer drinkers took a smell and thought it was hard alcohol). The aroma consists of bourbon, dark chocolate, prunes, and raisins. Honestly, the profile fits more with a barleywine than a stout. Initially, I wasn't getting a ton of vanilla, but as it warms the vanilla comes through. To a lesser degree, I can smell coconuts and coffee. Unsurprisingly, no hop character.

T&M: This is sweet stout, without much of a bitter profile. Some of the major components of this beer's taste include figs, port wine, blackstrap molasses, and barrel character (bourbon, oak, vanilla). Other tones include maple syrup and caramel. Consistent, not much changes about this beer as it warms. This beer is dangerous because you can smell the alcohol in the aroma, but the ABV is super hidden in the taste. Also no hop characters. The mouthfeel is very thick and smooth, but not chewy or velvety. The mouthfeel resembles the appearance in the sense it is a little oily. I would like a tiny more carbonation. Very warming. The mouthfeel is different than many other American Imperial Stouts.

Overall: This is currently the highest-rated beer I have ever reviewed on BA. Part of the reason I picked this beer is because I loved A Deal With The Devil so much. Overall, it was an amazing beer, but that isn't surprising considering the hype of being #5 American imperial stout and #7 overall and the price. Having said that, I wouldn't buy this one again due to cost. For almost 6 dollars an oz, I would expect something truly mind-blowing. Looking over my American Imperial Stout list I would say this is on par with Abraxas, CBS, and Grey Monday for a much cheaper price tag. I wonder if some of the hype behind this beer cost bias (aka I want this beer to be soo good because otherwise it wasn't worth spending $70 on)."
Blessed,4.54,"2023 Vintage.

L -- As expected, intensely pitch black with a very quickly dissipating dark brown head produced with aerated pour. Less viscous than anticipated, and lowering appearance some because of some huge chunks of congealed coconut fat that plopped into the glass at the end of the pour. Recommend to decant this one.
S -- My girlfriend thinks it smells like a Ben and Jerry's shop, and I agree. Chocolate/coffee ice cream, almond joy candy bar, nougat, vanilla cupcake, bourbon, shredded coconut
T -- Vanilla frosting, oaky rye spiciness, wet barrel, dark chocolate fudge, dried cherry, coconut cream. The barrel character really comes in waves and is quite intense
F -- Oily and intensely flavorful, but not super velvety. Nice level of carb. Thankfully the coconut fat chunks dissolved by swirling the glass and didn't impact mouthfeel
O -- Really assertive, flavorful, and layered. My first Anchorage barrel aged offering and the vibe I get is that they're *really* into that wet barrel character

91/100"
Blessed,4.9,"375ml waxed and capped bottle into a Side Project snifter.

Pours dense and rich. No head or lace. Nearly flat. Huge mocha legs that look more like whiskey than beer. Nose is salted caramel chocolate, lactose, fudge, and cocoa. Dense and rich. What sets this apart is the perfect saltiness. The flavors are super intense but perfectly integrated with the barrel presence. Beer opens chocolate, lactose, and cocoa powder. Molasses and hazelnut in the middle with sprinkles of espresso. Loads of barrel. Slight saltiness in the middle. Breakfast syrup with a touch of bacon. Oak and more barrel in the finish. This is perfect. Body is full with low carbonation. Slick and boozy on the palate and goes down smooth. Rich and full but not exhausting or heavy. Long, lingering, filmy aftertaste.

I thought I'd tasted the spectrum but this one really sets itself apart. Near perfect."
Blessed,4.83,"Pours a pitch black color with no head. Only the alcohol legs stand out aesthetically. The aroma, though, might be one of the most multi-faceted yet delicate experiences I've encountered in the beer world. There's just so much going on, yet the notes of bourbon, chocolate, dark fruits, vanilla, coconut, and almonds are so harmonious and perfectly balanced, it just blows my mind. The flavor profile absolutely doesn't disappoint in the slightest, and I gave the aroma a 5! A fuckin' 5! I don't hand out 5's the way Stone Cold Steve Austin hands out Stone Cold Stunners, that's for sure. It opens with a huge hit of coconut and vanilla, revealing a midtaste of dark fruit goodness. Oak gradually appears on the back end, with a perfectly balanced hit of booze to cleanse the palate. Despite the extreme flavors, it's shockingly balanced, though perhaps less delicate than the aroma; that's my only real nit to pick, and I wonder if it's even worth picking. The feel is just a touch flat, but despite the intense, palate coating sweetness, the oak tannins and nuanced alcohol presence do enough to cleanse the palate. In general, it's extreme but somehow well rounded...the best of both worlds.

I don't regret spending $53 on this small bottle. Enough said. This right here - in my humble opinion - is a paragon of the beer world, and the best barrel aged stout I've ever sampled."
Blessed,4.5,"Sweet milk chocolate, a hint of savory/umami, prominent vanilla, fleshy raw coconut, and a bourbon barrel nose on this one! Great aromatics here! Taste follows with a thick and velvety, milk chocolate-covered coconut, and a big, vanilla-bourbon barrel boozy heat finish. And I mean heat! Whoa! Not sure if it is this particular bottle, but that boozy backend is the only drawback IMO. This is absolutely delicious! I just wish a little more balance was given to the barrel treatment here."
Blessed,4.88,"WOW, what a beer. Black as ink with a tiny brown head that leaves absolutely no lacing, unless you count the brownish staining from the charred beer. Nose is coffee and charr, but also alcohol. Taste is very chocolatey, then the warmth builds from the alcohol, however not overwhelmingly so. Very smooth beer. Great beer."
Blessed,4.8,"Part of me wanted to age this for a long time. And then things in my life recently made me feel we should do what we can while we can, so maybe I should drink the hugest ranked beer I have in my collection.

It’s sweet, flavorful, balanced, and boozy.

Dark, very brown edging, oil sheen top.

Strong sweet notes of coconut, vanilla, toasted dark malt, and bourbon barrel so strong it can burn your nose hair.

Taste is a duel between strong booze of the bourbon barrel and the sweetness of the coconut and vanilla.

Feel is the weak point here. It’s maybe too much of a booze burn, and it’s a bit sticky and thick. I’m thinking aging it would have helped, and it’s my fault for that.

But I wanted to try this beer, and I did. Glad I did. It’s big on flavor and booze and very enjoyable for the attempt."
Blessed,4.37,Way to sweet for my palate - but I feel very blessed that I had the opportunity to try it
Blessed,4.63,"2021 editiion, drank May 2022. So sweet, even the small bottle was a lot to drink solo. Ten Years was much more balanced."
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,4.27,"LONG time want of mine! 2016 vintage. Unfortunately, most of the cocoa, vanilla, and cinnamon has faded already. All that remains is the apple brandy, and strong ancho chilies. Spicy burn on finish. I’m sure it’s a shell of its former self."

Heady Topper,4.4,"Poured from a 45F chilled can into a 16oz pint glass. Clean white head that dissipates, some lacing on the glass. Appearance is medium amber, hazy.
Aroma is that of a west coast ipa with tropical fruits and flowery hops. Taste follows the aroma with a punch in the mouth of hops ... grapefruit, some apricot, pine, some malt and biscuit in there, lingering pepper notes on the backend. Pretty well balanced between some sweetness in the front on the tongue and then bitterness from the hops on the end.
Mouthfeel is smooth with medium carbonation and medium-light body. Not too heavy. A little chew in the mouth to keep reminding you it's still there playing on your palette.
Overall a very well-crafted beer. First time Ive had it, very tasty. It is well-above avg DIPA, one of the better ones that I've had. Would certainly purchase again if I see it down this way."
Heady Topper,4.71,"Look - this is an ugly, cloudy beer; probably part of the reason for the direction to drink it from the can

Smell - layered floral waves; amazing

Taste - this beer is liquid marijuana; the hop flavors border a hallucinogenic experience; there is no hint of fusel; despite the shit ton of hops, it is all balanced

Feel - pure cream

Overall - the World-Class rating is earned. This is my number 1 beer each summer in Vermont."
Heady Topper,3.69,I have had this beer several times and IMO it is the most overrated beer in America. Really not pleasant and bitter. Second Fiddle blew it away head to head. Hard pass
Heady Topper,4.75,"This beer it’s kind of the standard for Hazy IPAs. I gave it 4.75 because I know that there is always room for improvement but if you wanna know what a real NEIPA taste like , this beer must be on your list."
Heady Topper,5.0,"Discovered this beer while skiing in Stowe years ago. Little did I know it was a legendary, bucket list beer for many. So fresh tasting. A masterpiece."
Heady Topper,5.0,"The beer of beers. Its so smooth, so creamy, and satisying. My personal #1"
Mornin' Delight,3.81,"12.5% ABV.

Pours a nearly black color. There's a bit of a tan colored collar ringing the glass, but no real head forms. The aroma is simple, yet extremely effective. Maple syrup literally explodes out of the glass aromatically, yet is balanced somewhat by the nuanced black coffee and roasted malt. My only complaint is the lack of infinite depth, but what's here is intoxicating. The flavor follows closely. It opens with the same explosion of maple syrup that destroyed my glass when I was inhaling the aroma. (Not sure how I'm still drinking and reviewing this...) The coffee presence feels reticent, though I do enjoy the upsurge of dark fruit flavors on the back of my palate...no, I'll just come out and say it. This is too damn sweet. Nuances are lost to the palate crushing sweetness, though the flavor profile itself is still good. Despite being absurdly sugary, I enjoy the soft, creamy mouthfeel. I wish it was drier, though. Carbonation is low. Yep...this one isn't for me. I can't give it a bad or even a less-than-good score because it does a lot of things very well, but it's just way too sweet and tiring to drink. I'd love to try the BA variant, too bad that's a literal-ass whale (then again, I never thought I'd ever find Mornin' Delight just a few years ago...)"
Mornin' Delight,4.54,"2023 vintage. 7.75 oz pour on tap for $13.50. Pours pitch black with a voluminous tan head. Aroma and flavor feature a TON of maple syrup, along with coffee, dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon. Sweet but not cloying. Definitely some alcohol heat which would probably become smoother with age. Obviously super glad to have tried this, but didn't quite live up to the hype for me. It's quite tasty but strikes me as a giant maple bomb first and foremost."
Mornin' Delight,4.82,Pours as dark as it possibly be. Not much head to speak of. He knows has a chard smell to it. The taste is sweet with a caramel and likely maple flavor to it. Nice warm on the throat. Wow is all I can say.
Mornin' Delight,4.99,"Finally had this--one of USA's Holy Grail beers--at Henry's in Saratoga Springs, NY. Believe the hype! Jet black pour with a thin tan creamy head. Maple syrup and espresso nose. This beer glides down the hatch delivering maple sweetness, light chocolate which is then balanced with a slightly bitter coffee tannin finish. It's just flat-out brilliant. Grab one and don't let go."
Mornin' Delight,4.75,Holy Maple!!!
King Julius,4.7,"A - Pours a cloudy and milky cream-cicle orange with a nice sudsy pillow of bright white head. This beer seems to have a back lighting glow.

S - Citrus and tropical fruits, piney, some dank notes.

T - Just an absolutely complex flavor bomb that has a tropical fruit, citrus, piney and dank hop party in your mouth.

F- Mellow up front, but a bit of a palate wrecker on the back end.

O - This is my favorite of all the Tree House brews I was able to try. Just an incredible beer in every way."
King Julius,4.76,"Gifted can from Drew. Extraordinary NEIPA.
For my self I’d like to think this is a very top end NEIPA vs IPA. Having had King JJJuliusss and Julius on tap at TH… this seemed like a unique great brew somewhere between the 2. Not surprising but no less wonderful.
Pour produced rich plumy white head which dissipated fairly quickly with little lacing but a decent thin halo. Nose is pleasant fruit…mangoes and straw. Taste brought in orange but creamy not pushy citrus. Likewise the other fruits in the base malt/hops combination had a creamsicle vs raw fruit taste. I found it inviting and excellent. There was residual resin on back end that worked. Overall a superb easy tasty orange creamsicle with some mango, papaya and passion fruit with a complimentary mild dank. Body was very smooth, slightly thin for DIPA… and supported by a some medium bright soft carb.
Again a big complex and delicious brew that seems like a great NEIPA. It does not nor need to be considered a DIPA considering all the examples then/now from other excellent breweries.
I found this less complex nor or taste; not as big/ full but considerably more tasty than King JJJuliusss I had earlier this evening.
Definitely what I could say is the King Julius is one of the …if not the best NEIPA… I’ve had for those brews that are full tropical plus dank. Highly enjoyed. Grateful to have tried."
King Julius,4.3,Pours a cloudy cream orange with a finger of foamy head that slowly dissipates to a thin ring with plenty of lacing. Aroma of orange and mango. Taste follows nose. Full-bodied.
King Julius,4.28,"Appearance - The beer was hazy yellowish orange with a fluffy white head.

Smell - Light citrus notes came from the glass, mostly orange.

Taste - Initially, the taste was big orange. It was smooth and almost fluffy like some thing from a juice bar. The finish was slightly dry and almost oaky. I was grateful it didn’t have that peppery sensation.

Mouthfeel - The body was thick, allowing Orange to claim the time.

Overall - This is not my favorite Tree House."
King Julius,4.6,"The grown up, ""I'm only having one drink tonight"" version of Julius.

It's all good, no complaints."
King Julius,4.45,"huge thanks to a friend for bringing this all the way across the country for me. crazy to be drinking the 12th highest rated beer in the world according to this prestigious website! i have to say, rarity aside, as delicious as this is, its hard to really class it that high, i can think of numerous others that play in this same space just as well, the super hazy majorly dry hopped strong new england ipa style, without half the fanfare, which is not a critique of this, and rankings are subjective and all of that, more a neat thing to consider while sipping it than it really being indicative of superiority, which is totally fine, i feel lucky to have the opportunity to enjoy a can with a pal! slightly murky to even a little dull in color, dense but not with visible sediment, and the head is as creamy as rich whipped cream, dense and lasting, really crowns this nicely, almost belgian looking but thicker. the nose is cool, tangerines, peaches at peak ripeness, new school sativa buds, white grape and pineapple hard candy, almost a confectionary sweetness, not malty really to me but im sure there are some oats in this, cereals under all the hops but simple also, orange juice and mimosa, light vanilla, light greenness from all the hop pellets, seems fresh, bold, grassy too as it sits, intriguing and definitely original, as is the flavor. definite orange julius vibes, i think thats a fair claim for this and good branding, appropriate. navel orange, its full essence, orange hard candy too, again with some sweetness and vanilla that doesnt seem to come from malt, center of the palate, enhancing the hops, which are super saturated in this but only faintly vegetal. green grape, new tennis balls, peach rings, lemon sorbet, and well grounded by the dry grain. some late bitterness but more juicy hoppy than biting, and the whole thing is positively pillow soft, effervescent, and distinctive, it stays on the palate awhile too without being a bruiser, its got body but the alcohol is out of the way, and of course the quality is near the head of the class. i think its ranking is odd, there are others this good and better out there, its a hype driven thing that keeps fueling itself, but it was killer to get a chance to finally drink this. very good."
King Julius,4.68,"L - straight up looks like a slightly darker orange juice with a frothy white head that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving behind a good amount of lacing
S - soft tropical fruit notes - tangerine and mango with orange and pineapple with faint hops
T - orange citrus, tangerine, mango, pineapple up front and throughout with a slight hop presence, though no bitterness. Good amount of malt to tie things together.
F - medium, leaning on full bodied with moderate carbonation. Soft, very smooth. Juicy
O - this one took me by surprise at first, and maybe not in the best way. It's such a different beer from other tree house NEIPAs in my opinion because its smoothed out hop profile. The hops are present but there is no bitterness or abrasiveness at all, combined with the very present citrus - mainly orange and tangerine - and tropical fruit notes - mango and pineapple, make this a very smooth, yet somewhat subdued beer. It's pretty fantastic, but I think my preference leans towards Very Hazy overall and standard Julius to this"
King Julius,4.13,"This one is highly rated so I was expecting fireworks. They weren't forthcoming.
It pours dark orange with a nice thick head, but really not much of a nose.
Mostly it has notes of wood, with a little malt and also papaya.
Listen, it is a good beer. If this would be the only beer to drink in the entire world, I would be fine with it. But I didn't find it to be such a standout. Badlands Brewing in Ontario beats the bejeezus out of it, any day, with several of their offerings."
King Julius,5.0,Truly lovely.
King Julius,4.77,"Cracked open the can. Immediate notes of a proper hazy. OJ, tropical notes. Check. Very opaque and cloudy yellow orange with a flash of a white head and ton of carbonation on the side.

The sip is like something illicitly good. The immediate nanosecond of a sip you can tell what's about to happen. It's opulently smooth and you want more before you even when you haven't finished a mouthful yet. The description is apt in that any bitter or abrasiveness has been completely tamed and just bows down to what your taste buds want to hear: smooth tropical juice. Anything counter to that smoothness has been surgically excised. It's very strong and extremely smooth for the ABV with no noticeable alcohol save for some build up of heat while drinking. It's interesting because there is still some level of hop fire but it's extremely smooth and pleasant. It's great."
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.93,"Batch 11 - 2023 (black wax) - just a superb beer. Pours a deep, dark brown color with an amazing nose of barrel and caramel / sweetness. Taste hits you with perfect balance; that's what sets this apart - it's as if the entire beer plays nice with all of its parts, intense flavors of barrel, sweetness, raisin and caramel, complimented by dark fruit and brown sugar.
I might say it's a smidge thin for me, but that's if I'm TRYING to find a flaw. It's the embodiment of a perfect BA barleywine, IMO. Right up there with MJK and 10 Yr BW from SP. I think 10 Yr BW edges this out by the narrowest of margins, but let's be honest, I'm not turning either down given the chance to have it again. What a beverage. One of those beers that you were almost pissed that you decided to split it instead of solo-doming. :)"
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.86,"Briljant beer and worth searching for.
In the nose - a really nice and complex smell that longs for another sniff.
Taste- complex, sweet but not overwhelming, caramel, tannins and vanilla from the barrel.
Overall- excellent flavor and taste, not unbalanced in anyway."
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.73,"Thank you to noblepudding, a prince among traders, for sending this fancy, gold-waxed bottle to the northern steppes. 375ML, Batch #7.

The pour is a muddied brown-red with the expected lack of bubbles. The nose is a sharp spike of bourbon & booze.

A Deal with the Devil – Triple Oaked is a multi-layered beast. The booze is off the charts for a malt-based product & the bourbon exhale is spectacular; if I drank the stuff I suspect I could pull some of the various bottles out of the layers. Underneath that glorious noise is black, bruised, sweet fruit just on the edge of gone, molasses, achingly sweet, before the desiccated oak brings it home. Shame this bottle is so small. I have lots of sick/vacation time to use on three of these in a night.

Well, damn. Anchorage rarely misses on their big bottles & they better not based on the price point. This is transcendent."
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.87,"Pours a deep, dark brown color. Aroma is an amazing, complex combination of dark fruits, oak, bourbon with hints of caramel and a tad bit of coconut. Taste follows nose but with more intensity of flavor and sweetness -- the dark fruits (fig and plums), brown sugar, caramel, bourbon and the oak. So very balance and very present in the taste without distracting from the other flavors. Full bodied, traditional ADWTD mouthfeel. Incredible barleywine and worth the wait."
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.6,"2021 batch 3, drank in June 2022. Didn't get as much from this as previous ADWTD. Felt sweet without complexity that you would expect. Still very delicious, just not worth the price."
Zenne Y Frontera,4.68,"Batch 1 (no foil).
Bottling date: 1/3/2014
best before: 1/3/2024
ABV: 7%

Provenance: Stored at 3 Fonteinen's Beersel cellar (lambik-O-droom) until July 11, 2024. Fridge-stored at hotel and flown back to the U.S. on July 12, where it's been cellar stored at 50° until opening.

Beautiful copper flecked golden coloration. A gentle pour from the cradle agitates minimal head; this one is quick to settle flat.

The nose is fantastic. A bright introduction of lemon zest and floral honey play contrast to distinctly musty, mildly cheesy notes on the back end. There's an orchestrated balance, and the interplay between those touches of ammonia and oak with the zesty citrus and punches of honey sweetness make for a truly special aromatic intro.

The palate is a masterclass in oak treatment and blending. While time has brought such delicacy to this inaugural batch, there's still a noticeable sharpness. An initial punch of lemon rind and oaky dryness opens the door for a previously dormant acidity to surge into the mid-palate. The finish leaves with it a soft puckering to accompany low bitterness and a whisper of ammoniated funk.

A light-bodied geuze, with low but present carbonation. Medium acidity, with a bit of lingering pucker. The finish is tart, with drying tannins helping to cut the lingering acid.

With 30 minutes to decant, the nose becomes a bit more cohesive and a touch funkier, while the palate slightly decreases in its acidity while the oak is more noticeable on the front-end of the palate."
Zenne Y Frontera,4.6,18/19 blend 93.
Pliny The Younger,4.82,"L -Golden with brilliant clarity and a white head that dissipates somewhat quickly, leaving behind a frothy cap and some lacing
S - bright, piney, resinous hops, citrus, malt, some honey
T - Follows the nose: bright, piney, resinous hops intermixed well with citrus - a good amount of orange along with grapefruit with a nice malt backbone to tie things together. Biscuit and some honey notes as well. Some grass as well. Very clean tasting.
F - medium leaning on full bodied with moderate carbonation
O - Like pliny the elder, nothing seems extreme or overdone with this beer, despite being an amped up version of PTE. It's just incredibly well balanced and well done. One of the best TIPAs out there."
Pliny The Younger,4.69,"The color is golden with a tiny head and lace.
The aroma is a fruit basket with piney hops.
The taste is piney, malts, citrus, tropical fruit and tons of hops, but not overpowering.
The feel was creamy, incredible balance and a medium to almost a lighter body than expected.
The finish was so smooth and the alcohol was well hidden.
I waited 10 years before all the stars aligned and I was able to try this beer at Monks in PA.
I had two glasses which was the max permitted.
I still think that this beer holds up well among the rest of the great IPA's out there."
Pliny The Younger,4.15,"I had this beer on-tap in a tulip glass at Special Brews in Lynnwood, WA.

Appearance: medium-light golden hue with just the tiniest wisp of haze and practically no head.

Smell: a light, sweet, almost tropical fruitiness with some piney hop character atop a pretty pronounced malt aroma. Nice.

Taste: richly malty and a bit sweet, but with lots of bitterness backing it up. There’s a little fruity character here, I’m thinking from fermentation, along with some piney/grassy notes from the hops. It’s interesting — a rich flavorful beer, but neither as cloying nor as harsh as TIPAs often are. Worth the hype? Maybe. But certainly a good beer.

Mouthfeel: medium body with a good level of carbonation and creaminess.

Overall: I like this beer a lot, and I bet if I’d tried it 15 years ago it would have blown my mind (and my palate). In today’s IPA climate, competition is tough and we as consumers are spoiled. That said, this remains a really tasty beer."
Pliny The Younger,4.8,"Not sure what else needs to be said about this beer, it's pretty close to perfection for the style. A little on the light side, piney and bitter with a touch of sweetness. Intense flavors and very very smooth."
Pliny The Younger,5.0,"Pours golden yellow with slight white lacing crown on special edition (once a year) draught at Malibu Wine & Beer. Notes of honey and crisp perfect hops, slightly sweet with a perfect hop punch. This limited batch hard to get pour drinks like a single IPA but checked in at hefty 10.25% ABV putting it into triple IPA category. CHEERS to Russian River and the perfect IPA."
Coconut Vibes - Barrel-Aged,4.9,"Bucket list beer! Just so happened I was in St. Louis when this was released, lucky me!
Look - Typical dark stout appearance.
Smell - OMG, coconut, vanilla, liquid mounds bar but not cloyingly sweet. Very well balanced.
Taste - Amazing, viscous coconut sensation. I'm floating!
Feel - Thick smooth velvet on the tongue. Perfect!
Overall - Hands down the best barrel aged coconut beer I've ever had. King Coconut!"
Coconut Vibes - Barrel-Aged,4.01,Cloyingly sweet.. Not even the barrel treatment could mask it
Coconut Vibes - Barrel-Aged,5.0,Bottle share with Rob. For me this is about as good as beer gets. Wonderful mouthfeel and coconut flavor.
Coconut Vibes - Barrel-Aged,4.38,"2023 bottle. Aromas and flavors are dominated by coconut; not sure if this bottle was off, but got a heavy alcohol bite up front. It mellowed mid palate, but still was offputting. Very thick and smooth from a mouthfeel perspective. Honestly enjoyed Batch 3 of the non-ba version of this better than the 2023 bottle. Shame I missed 2019 at Stout Week - was hoping to compare."
Coconut Vibes - Barrel-Aged,4.21,"2023 vintage. Pours nearly still and super syrupy in the glass with noticeable congealed coconut fat in suspension. Not exactly the most appealing, but definitely sets the stage in terms of viscocity. This is easily the most coconut-forward beer I've ever had -- both the aromas and flavors are dominated by intense notes of shredded coconut, coconut macaroon, and coconut ice cream. Quite perceivable booziness in the aromas in particular, but things are smoothed out by the liquid brownie batter character in the flavors quite nicely. Hugely thick, velvety, and viscous, the mouthfeel is only knocked down a hair by the near-cloying sweetness. It's definitely a punch-you-in-the-face kind of beer. Leaps and bounds beyond the other coconut-forward BA stouts out there? Not really. But it is damn decadent

85/100"
Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.42,"Had on site draft from the brewery. Lucky it was on tap while I was there, but as with most pours on site (not just at AC), it was ice cold. Gave it the appropriate time to warm. I have had the non-ba version. The barrel definitely helps the tooth curdling sweetness in the non-BA version. I think it's great on the nose, but even as a BA stout, this is still a little too sweet for me. I think 5 years ago I'd have thought I went to heaven and died having this. In 2024, my palate just likes less of these adjuncts, or a much smaller pour. Great dessert stout, no question, but I think my palate just likes this type of beer less than it used to."
Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,5.0,Unbelievably delicious desert stout. Highly recommended!
Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.34,"Had after having the non-ba version. Yeah, the barrel helped! Instead of a sugary finish, now there is a sweet and booze concoction. The barrel isn't complex but it smooths out the balance here, allowing the coconut, vanilla and chocolate to shine without any getting too strong. Smell really shows this off, where taste the cumulative sweetness does start to get on the radar. Still a very good dessert stout"
Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,1.45,My bottle was heavily infected. 2022. Anyone else have this happen?
Vanilla Rye Bourbon County Brand Stout,5.0,"11/23/2019 - poured from a 22oz bottle into a Morning Delight snifter. I cracked this beer to celebrate my first 3+ mile run after recovery from achilles surgery in May, 2019. Loved everything about this (booze, vanilla, thickness)."
Vanilla Rye Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.55,This was a great beer. Had it on draft with my buddy on Black Friday at Goose after picking up our bottles from Binny's in 2019.
Vanilla Rye Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.46,"Hot on the heels of that classic Bourbon County Brand Stout flavor and the need to reach new heights, Goose Island keeps the wholesome goodness coming with both vanilla and rye. Amplified creaminess, richness, and smoothness all come to the forefront for the most succulent of stouts.

The monsterous stout pours an oily-inky and truly viscous pour of blackness with brownish legging. Formitable early head formation falters underneath the enormous gravity and alcohol of the beer. Completely opaque, the beer draws you in with most seductive of intent. Mouthwatering aromas of bitter cocoa, espresso, burnt toffee, maple syrup, brown sugar, and unmistakable rye whisky. The warming beer emits scents reminiscent of dark fruit, licorice, stone fruit and wood spice.

Sultury flavors of chocolate wafers, creamy vanilla, molasses, and sweet barrel nuances blend together for a flavor that's quite like Bourbon Ball candies. Walnuts, robust coffees, and port-like fruitiness continue to contribute new layers of flavors with each and every sip, and all wrapped in a soft vanilla envelope. Incredibly powerful in flavor, the sweetness of malt is seemingly amplified by the vanilla and reduces the roast flavor to that of mocha latte and less like true espresso; helping with the harsh roast but allowing for a heavy, icing-like sweetness.

Ultimate fullness, richness, and oily- stouts don't get much bigger. The beer coats the mouth similarly to heavy sweetened fortified liquors like cognac, port, or honey liquors. Sweetness masks the alcohols, allowing for a high level of drinkability despite its alcohol content. Very warm, but never harsh, the beer is a true desert with each sip and gives a long bourbon/chocolate linger time after time. A long and savory aftertaste of roast and vanilla come with the woodsy, peppery and earthen grit that's special to rye barrels."
Double Barrel V.S.O.J.,4.85,"Pours a dark mahogany brown color with an unfiltered look, and settles in the glass with a nearly black body and a soapy tan head that dissipates pretty quickly, which isn’t surprising given the 16.8% ABV. Absolutely gorgeous barleywine.

The first note on the nose is an intense oak aroma that is a product of the boozy barrel note that follows, then lush, decadent caramel and toffee notes, and just a hint of stone fruit as plums and a bit of raisin. I am slobbering on myself.

The taste has all of the components of the nose, with the luxuriously decadent caramel and toffee flavors up front, the oak cutting the sweetness, and the plums a smidge of tart fruit that is a perfect finish coasting into the boozy warming at the back of the palate from the barrel.

The mouthfeel is rich, full, and decadent, suiting a beer of this gravity like a glove. This is a tippity top world class barleywine that I can’t recommend highly enough. Truly magnificent."
Double Barrel V.S.O.J.,5.0,"A big thank you to Quinnimical for knocking this 12 oz. can off my wants list. And since I pretty much want everything Revolution ever makes, I’m sure it’ll be replaced by 3X Barrel Super Ultimate VSOJ soon.

The pour is even darker than regular plain old VSOJ. The bouquet is intensely alcoholic, shedding bourbon & spicy rye all over the interior of my nasal cavity.

Double Barrel V.S.O.J. is a true sipper. The grossly understated 14% ABV hits like Joey Browner in his prime, suffusing all of the senses, including a few I didn’t know I possessed. Rye dominates, bourbon places second, then the barleywine tries to get a few words in with brown sugar, toffee, caramel, molasses, with sharp oak on the finish. Well, other than the alcohol finish, of course. I wonder how much of this I could drink before my brain waves flatlined.

Sometimes massive barrel is just massive barrel. Sometimes it’s beautifully integrated with a great beer. This is the latter. A masterclass in barrel aging that, well, I can find no flaw in. In sixteen years of searching the world, here is my eight perfect beer. I love it."
Double Barrel V.S.O.J.,4.68,"Had on tap. V.S.O.J. is one of my favorite beers of all time. So there is no way this can meet that bar.... right? Expand the barrel character of vsoj and add more gushing caramel up front, resulting in a taste that is the epitome of barrel candy with enough barley and oak to balance. Body is lush and stupid smooth with plenty of booze backing. Smell is the one area that is simpler than the orignal just because the barrels are so strong (and beautiful), fitting my conclusions of the beer: it is more potent and deep, but not as complex and drinkable, a very warm sipper that is so rewarding. The wife loved it. Well done rev again!"
Double Barrel V.S.O.J.,4.53,"Darker in color compared to straight jacket. Very smooth with so much depth. Compared to the regular straight jacket, this one is far more robust, less sweet, but with heavy prunes, toffee, bourbon, and even a hint of white wine. No alcohol burn so you have to watch yourself!"
Double Barrel V.S.O.J.,4.8,"sampling a 12 oz can poured into my snifter at cellar temp. Date stamp is 12/29/2022.
The beer pours a dark rich mahogany color into my glass. Only the lightest tints of light get through the glass.
A fizzy beige head of 1 cm foams up but fades to a thin edge layer quickly after the pour. The edging does stick around for most of the sampling.
Aroma is toffee, brown sugar, some bourbony/rye sweetness, a bit of dry wooden barrel, almost like a popsicle stick note. There are hints of fusol booze here too, but no hop notes that I can detect.
First sip reveals a fairly robust body and syrupy texture. Carbonation is fine and tingly, sticky coating on my palate after each sip. Swallow reveals a bit of warmth on the finish. Physical traits make this a sipping beer.
Flavor is similar to what the nose predicts with malt forward character. I get toffee, brown sugar and general malt sweetness. There is a rye/bourbon note that carries through for sure and I keep tasting maple syrup, even though I dont think thats an additive. I dont get any hop character on this beer. Booze is limited to warmth, with no peppery bite or spiciness.
A sweeter sipping beer that I am enjoying and very happy to have had the chance to drink tonight while watching Dallas vs Seattle."
Double Barrel V.S.O.J.,4.81,"12oz. Can I to a BBT snifter.

Pours coca cola. Near flat. No head, no lace. Super thick, oily lace. Nose is rich and aromatic. Notes of nutmeg, hazelnut, brown sugar, and molasses. Booze is apparent but subtle. Beer opens chocolate, brown sugar, anise, and dried dark fruit. Molasses, barrel, sweet cream, and breakfast syrup in the middle and end. Oak, some tobacco, and burnt brown sugar at the end and aftertaste. Body is medium to full with low carbonation. Slick and oily on the palate and goes down rich and slightly boozy. Dry, lingering aftertaste that goes on for days.

This is the perfect English Barleywine. Insanely well integrated and complementary flavor profile with a body to match. Incredible."
Fundamental Observation,4.56,"500 ml bottle into a snifter. The 2023 edition, had 7/27/24.

Pours near black and opaque, with a slight head and a light oily smear on the glass. Aromas of vanilla, chocolate, malted milk balls, malt, some oak, light bourbon, a little char. The barrels make a bigger appearance in the flavor, which is more focused: bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, malt, some oak. Smooth, somewhat creamy, a solid full body, appropriately carbonated but a touch fizzy feeling.

A standout. Have had this a few times at events, quite delighted to finally obtain a bottle. All that delicious vanilla leads the way here, of course.

RFOB18 0471"
Fundamental Observation,4.45,"Pours black and thick with a dark chocolate colored foaming.
Smells like malt and dark chocolate, with a touch of bourbon. Maybe a little licorice and figs. The bourbon may be loverpowering the vanilla in the smell, as I am not getting any vanilla smell. (Note: after coming back to it a few minutes later, the bourbon has mellowed and the vanilla comes through really well.)
Taste is delicious. The vanilla comes through here, even with a bit of a bourbon flavor. The dark dried fruits flavor comes through nicely. The malt flavor is good.
Feel is not quite as smooth and viscous as I expected. It’s still good, but not as good as it looked when pouring. The carbonation seems to give it more fizz than I would like.
Overall, a great beer. I suggest letting it air a few minutes after pouring, then drinking a bit, then come back to eating it. It seems to change quite a bit from first opening to 5-10 minutes in, for the better."
Fundamental Observation,4.49,"Received a 2022 bottle from @Beersnake1 3-13-23. Reviewed 12-14-23.

Beer poured black with a very nice tan head with the initial pour-4.25.

Nose is awesome as i am getting a medium roasted malt base that absorbs the rest in the bourbon barrels which lends notes of cocoa and bourbon. The vanilla adjunct is very prevalent and lends a nice tangent-4.5.

Taste is a medium roasted malt base that gives a big dose of vanilla up front with the barrels lingering in the background. With subsequent sips the blast of vanilla is coalescing with the barrels and am getting cocoa presumably from the choice of malts used. Finishes almost sweet but hopping and the barrels take that away-4.5.

Mouthfeel is very good as the large malt base is very viscous and each sip delightfully smooth-4.5.

Overall, initially graded Taste at 4.25 because it seemed to have too much vanilla but as my palate acclimated everything came together very nicely. A big thanks to Tim for a very generous trade! Overall rating 4.49."
Fundamental Observation,4.84,"L- A glorious ebony with a dark brown
head.

S- BA Bourbon booze upfront with some
very ripe stone fruit and raisins.

T- Vanilla, vanilla, vanilla upfront and
very pleasant. Some hops and slight
bitter dark chocolate.

F- Quite viscous and velvety smooth
mouthfeel with very delicate carbonation.

O- World class is an understatement!
Other worldly phenomal is apt!"
Fundamental Observation,4.54,"2023 vintage

Afterr being impressed by my first few Bottle Logic beers, I’ve landed their white whale. This currently sits as the 17th highest rated beer on BA, their highest rated brew. I’ve been wanting to try this one for quite some time, so let’s just get right into it

Pours completely pitch black with 2 fingers of frothy dark brown head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

The nose is sweet but quite complex. I’m picking up on aromas of vanilla bean, burnt caramel, earthy bourbon, brown sugar, molasses, toasted oak, walnut, chocolate fudge, raisin, and light roast coffee

It’s very similar in taste and I have absolutely no complaints about that. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting chocolate fudge, vanilla bean, dark bread, caramel, medium roast coffee, sweet bourbon, charred oak, raisin, brown sugar, and light molasses. The swallow brings notes of toasted oak, molasses, vanilla bean, walnut, dark chocolate, medium roast coffee, black cherry, burnt caramel, sweet bourbon, and raisin

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a silky beer. Finishes surprisingly dry for how sweet it is and drinks below its abv

Oh man, this one absolutely lives up to the hype! I was a bit hesitant given how sweet it is, but it remains very balanced throughout. Great stuff"
Fundamental Observation,4.71,"Pours a deep, dark brown color. Aroma is a wonderful combination of rich chocolate, deep vanilla with hints of bourbon and dark fruits. Taste is really intense combination following nose -- dark chocolate, strong vanilla, fruity and bourbon flavors. Mouthfeel is full bodied. Overall incredible stout."
Fundamental Observation,4.44,"2022 vintage (batch 8) served in my Bruery snifter. Pours one shade shy of black. Complexion is opaque. Head ins loose and mocha-colored and quickly disperses into a tight band around the shoulders and an oily slick across the surface. Nose is decadent vanilla, caramel, cocoa and spirits. This is going to be decadently sweet! Taste follows nose - spirits are subdued and only come out at the finish. The rest is just pure candy. Mouthfeel is medium in body with a semi-still carbonation. Overall, an amazing imperial stout."
Fundamental Observation,4.54,"500ml capped bottle into a BBT snifter.

Pours with a 1 finger dark mocha head. Beer pours heavy, pitch black, viscous. Sticky, mocha legs. Nose is chocolate, vanilla, molasses, and barrel. Pungent and rich. Beer opens chocolate, vanilla, and fudge. Hints of cocoa powder and roasted malt. Big barrel overtones. More vanilla and molasses in the finish. Body is full with low carbonation. Sticky and viscous on the palate and goes down warm with a long, lingering, sticky aftertaste.

This is great. Simple but well made. Amazing body."
Fundamental Observation,4.89,One of my favorites from BL... I only had B1 a few years ago but Im catching up on my reviews.
Very Hazy,4.72,"L - Creamy, hazy, opaque straw/yellow with a frothy white head that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving behind a thin cap and some lacing. Looks like orange juice
S - peach and tropical fruit notes with piney hops, though the hops are subdued compared to Very Green
T - Peach and tropical fruit notes (pineapple and mango) up front and throughout with some citrus notes - grapefruit and orange - intermixed well with piney, slightly bitter hops. Solid amount of malt.
F - Full bodied with moderate carbonation. Pillowy soft
O - a pretty incredible NEIPA. Soft and full bodied with more peach and tropical fruit notes compared to Very Green which favored more bitter hops with tropical fruit notes and a less full body."
Very Hazy,4.6,"Deep orange in color with a thick white head. Nose is full on citrus and grapefruit. Taste is like nose, citrus of oranges and then grapefruit billows across the palate. Very soft feel, nice bitterness that builds then fades."
Very Hazy,4.97,A beer that feels like more beers should be had. Just wonderful.
Very Hazy,4.25,"2024-04-13
16oz can served in a curvy Monhegan pint glass. Can is dated 03/25/2024. Sent to me by @Roguer in NBS BIF #18.

Pours murky whitish-amber with a big, dense head, lots of active carbonation. Smell is bright lemon rind with a background of dense pine bitterness, almost earthy.

Taste is not as bright. Overripe tropical fruit, the earthiness of the bitter in the smell comes across more as fruit skin bitterness. Weak juicy undertone, dominated by resinous bitterness.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, dry, definite chalkiness. Overall, very nice."
Very Hazy,4.56,"Sent to me by der @WunderLlama during NBW BIF #18.
Poured that lovely yellow orange opaque color that, right or wrong, I expect from the style. The head was tall and nearly white and left rings of white lacing.
Afraid my sniffer is still out of order due to COVID, I only mention this because it seems to be a key component of this beer.
The taste though, whoa. Citrus fruits and pineapple abound, softer versions of lemon and mango and grapefruit.
The feel is mouth filling (okay, I may have gulped this a couple times...) -I expected more particulates but found none, it was such a soft yet quaffable beer that I had trouble drinking it slow enough to focus on what I was tasting.
Not sure how this isn't *the* standard, but then I'm a stout guy so you IPA people can argue that point."
Very Hazy,4.54,"From a 16oz can - 02/12/24 - Walt Likes Unicorns

As the name implies - Very Hazy. Very murky and juicy looking. 2 finger off white head. Great head retention. Awesome lacing on the glass.
Extremely tropical nose. I am hit while pouring the beer with tropical aromas. Up close I get a big hit of pineapple and mango.
Taste - The flavor is dominated by the hops. The hops are quite tropical. I get a huge pineapple hit, and it is backed up by mango. There's a bit of a pleasing bitterness on the backside.
Very juicy feeling. Very soft. Very full feeling. The hops do cling and linger in my throat.
The hype is real. This beer is totally solid and delicious."
Very Hazy,4.85,"The look is very hazy gorgeous apricot orange, with a thick off-white, busy-looking, foam top. The smell is incredible. Vibrant orange, peach, grapefruit, and mango scents jump from the can, and explode when the beer is poured into a glass. The flavor is mildly sweet orange juice, peach, grapefruit, mango, lemon, and jackfruit. The mouthfeel is thick, soupy, soft, and smooth, with medium carbonation. Overall, this beer is worthy of its rating. It is one of the best NEIIPAs available."
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,3.74,"Pours from the bottle black with a fizzy 1"" head that quickly dissipates, very little lacing. Nose is black licorice, molasses, dark fruit; charred barrel; alkaline cocoa powder, chalky roast, blackstrap molasses as it warms. What doesn't come across is coffee. Taste essentially follows - dark roasted fruit (stewed figs, cherries, and plums); woody barrel; salty licorice and molasses; dark chocolate. As it warms, boozier bourbon elements emerge (bourbon, vanilla, smoke, char), but still, very little coffee flavor. Mouthfeel is far lighter than other BCBS variants, and there's some prickly carbonation to boot. This is certainly a nice sipper, but as a coffee adjunct stout, it doesn't measure up to many in its class. Additionally, there are ample non-adjunct stouts that express more coffee flavor than this does."
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.77,"2022 vintage

I've had this bottle for over six months, and it finally came time to open it up. The anticipation was strong, and BCBCS lived up to both the hype and my expectations.

Typically black as night with a little bit of head and lacing.

Amazing chocolate, coffee, roasted, toasted and burnt aromas and flavors dance on your taste buds. The body is thick, rich and a little bit boozy, but in an expected way.

Pretty much everything about this beer shows that it deserves to be in the highest rankings of the style or indeed any beer from anywhere."
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.57,"500ml bottle with a cost nearly equivalent to a month's rent. Finally trying this most legendary of beers. 2022 Vintage with a best before of September 5, 2024. Served cool into a snifter. Highest rated beer I'm trying to date.

Appearance - Virtually black from the bottle and into the glass. A half finger of deep tan head is poured and fizzles out in about 60 seconds. A tiny collar of foam lingers a bit longer.

Smell - Nuanced aroma with huge bourbon notes, cocoa powder, nuts and fresh coffee beans. Vanilla and molasses in there as well, but akin to walking into a local independent coffee shop. Exceptionally robust.

Taste - Up front there's dark chocolate, some coffee, bourbon but not overplayed. Coffee, cocoa powder, vanilla afterwards. Sweet but not too sweet. Some sips bring much more bitterness with molasses playing a prominent role.

Mouthfeel - Full bodied, but exceptionally light on it's feet. Low carbonation with a nice warming touch in the back of the throat. There's a powdery texture at times that combines wonderfully with the cocoa powder flavor that feels so light.

Overall - Hard to say which I prefer between BCBCS and BCBS, but this is a wonderful coffee stout that pretty much lived up to expectations and hype. Not likely to purchase again soon given the hefty price tag and difficulty in obtaining it, but a very worthwhile endeavor that every BA should strive to sample if only just once."
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.58,Fresh BCBCS hits hard every GD time.
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.2,"This Brand, particularly with the Coffee, has gotten too carried away with itself and left me behind. It's all good, but it's not all this good to boast a 4.67 average... and certainly isn't World-Class in my book. In particular, the coffee is too prominent. Stouts are about blending malts, not blending coffee. Dark malts and coffee are usually at opposite ends of the day and for good reason: they really don't complement one another much, except in a very narrow range and with some brewer's luck.

This rendition (Burundi Turihamwe) was worth having. It is not worth having again. And it will never be worth the price. But, it was in my cellar and this is the month to clean it out. And for that I am grateful."
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.7,"My favorite Bourbon County yet. Tastes a lot like the original, except the added coffee makes it even better. A masterpiece from them."
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,3.99,"From a 500ml bottle, labeled 2022. Drink by 09/06/24. Served in a spiegelau ba tulip glass.

Pours chestnut-brown with a finger of chocolatey foam. The head holds up for under a minute, leaving a thin collar and a barely rousable, thin sheet of oily lacing.

Nose is rich and intense. Robust aroma of dark chocolate and molasses.

Taste pretty much as expected, but sweeter. Tasting chocolate syrup, malt syrup, dark brown sugar, cocoa nibs. Very little detectable coffee presence, just a hint of vaporous mocha along with the smoky bourbon late in the sip and in the sinuses.

Feel is dense, silky. A thick, syrupy body with vanishingly gentle, fine, prickly carbonation. A mild tannic film lingers on the tongue.

Overall, sweet, heavy and overly syrupy to my taste. In fact, more syrupy and hefty? than I remember straight Bourbon County being - if I’m remembering right."
Beer:Barrel:Time (Van Winkle 2023),4.85,"375ml bottle that is waxed with thick bronze/gold wax. Poured into Durobar Charente with SP light bulb logo glass.

Appearance: Midnight black body that has a small amount of dark brown head that collects near the outside of the glass. The head is short lived and eventually you have a black mirror on the top of the beer. Legs on the side of the glass along with lots of little black specs that cling to the side of the glass.

Smell: Rich chocolate cake. Rich bourbon with big barrel char. Marshmallow fluff and vanilla beans. The smell to me is actually more impressive than the flavor profile and that's no insult to the flavor of this BBA Imperial Stout.

Taste: Dry dark chocolate notes and moderate roasted malt notes that resemble a fresh brewed dark roast coffee. Big barrel char & smoke hits next transitioning into a rich note of bourbon that is sweet, but not too sweet. Floral vanilla beans that do not taste overly sweet, but add a deep richness to the overall effect. Slightly dry oak barrel in the finish. Perhaps some molasses, leather, and tobacco notes as well. As this beer warms up the chocolate notes really sweeten up in the best possible way from dark chocolate to an Oreo cookie type flavor.

Mouthfeel: This is a full bodied Stout; not pastry thick, but as thick as you can get perhaps 1 notch below pastry thick. It's definitely motor oil; very silky and velvety in its texture. Low and adequate carbonation levels. No booze to this at all.

Overall: This was an excellent pick as my birthday beer. Pappy barrels really do some amazing things to barrel aged stouts. Everyone knows this would be a banger for the SP barrel program."
Beer:Barrel:Time (Van Winkle 2023),5.0,Had this last year it was fantastic. Great smell great taste great look great feel would love to have it again. Was able to try this at the brewery straight from the bottle

A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,4.52,"Drank from a 12.7 fl. oz. / 375ml silver wax dipped bottle purchased on Tavour
Batch #5
Served in a tulip

Review #2325

The beer poured a syrupy and thick, deep mahogany hue. A mass of lager sized, saddle brown bubbles topped the liquid, but they quickly dissolved. The resulting body was shimmery and viscous and looked very similar to a spirit. After each sip, thick, sticky legs trickled down the sides of the glass.

The aroma was really intense. Uber malty and robust. Super boozy and complex. Brown sugar and dark fruit notes came through big time. Huge booze soaked raisin presence. Loads of stewed plum character too. Woody bourbon and port notes were prevalent from start to finish. Good dose of vanilla as well. The alcohol presence continued to intensify as the beer warmed.

The flavor profile mimicked the nose. Massively boozy and intense. Tons of dark fruit character. Like in the aroma, booze soaked raisins and woody bourbon notes dominated. Moderate roasted malt presence. Brown sugar was noticeable on the front end. Port notes appeared in the center. More boozy, oaky bourbon stave character on the back end and in the finish. Somewhat dry and tannic after the swallow. Sweet, boozy, bourbony notes and some woody char lingered.

Nice rich, syrupy mouthfeel. Full bodied but definitely not quite as viscous as I anticipated for a beer of this magnitude. Loads of alcohol heat. The liquid contained a super fine, mellow effervescence that worked nicely for the style.

A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged is unquestionably the most intense barleywine I have ever tried and an impressive example of the style. That said, the alcohol presence was almost a bit distracting. This is a beer that would likely be best enjoyed when split multiple ways with friends."
A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,4.82,"Single, Triple, now Double Oaked in the books. A 16 oz. can the likes of which I’ve never viewed, with the bottom of the can slathered in black wax. Funny, guys.

The pour is dark, with minimal, tiny bubbles clinging around the edges of the circle. Smells boozy, thick, like some kind of chunky batter.

A Deal with the Devil – Double Oaked harkens more towards III than I. The slyness of 1 is absent here, while the gullet-searing booze of III is popping. Cluster of bourbon greets the palate & it’s smooth, not harsh, an easy guest. Mid-palate is full, sweet, thick maltiness, anise, molasses, caramelized toffee. Belches bring up more delicious bourbon. Thick; close to sludgy. Neither that nor the future promise of a morning head-pounding would keep me from drinking a couple if I had them. Luckily, I do not.

This series is ridiculously good & crazy pricey. But like the other pair I’ve sample, this is a top-tier brew. In other words: yummy."
A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,4.72,"12.7 ounce wax capped bottle, Batch #5. Label says aged 7 months in Woodford Reserve Double Oaked barrels, then transferred to Willett bourbon barrels for an additional 11 months. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a very dark brown color with about a half inch tan head that didn't stick around for too long. Not much lacing at all. I like the aroma, the brew smells like dark fruit, bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, caramel and toffee. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some oak and molasses flavors. Mostly sweet tasting but not overwhelming at all. Nice oaky/woodiness lingering in the finish. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's coating and syrupy with a moderate amount of carbonation. A little boozy, but doesn't seem like it's 17% either. I thought this was a pretty good barleywine, definitely worth trying if you get the chance! I know I'd like to try some of the other variants one day."
V.S.O.J.,4.45,"Poured from a twelve ounce can, the body pours a dark brown with a light brown head. No much lacing.

Aroma is a sweet rush of bourbon barrel, toffee, and caramel.

Taste follows nose as the huge flavors translate to taste without diminution. More deep flavors appear: figs, oak, and vanilla. First rate malty goodness here. The ABV is well masked as there is just a little booze on finish.

Mouthfeel is very good, soft with supportive carbonation.

A strong, malty delight. Some folks may find it too sweet, but it's a rare beer that's wonderful to sip and patiently savor."
V.S.O.J.,4.57,"Canned 7/9/24. Bought at the brewery 7/21/24. Poured at 56°. Super fast fizzy lite tan head that vanished before I could snap a pic; no cap retention save a small island of micro dots, no ring no lace; thin legs at best for 14.4% abv. Caramel malt and sweet bourbon nose. Taste is sweet caramel malt and bourbon, sugary raisins, plums and dark fruit (cherries); some oak/vanilla in the finish. Mouth warmth from 14.4%, light carbonation; creamy medium heavy body; smooth, lux feel. Overall, this BBA BW is the real deal; surprised after all these years of enjoying this beer I’m just now reviewing … buy. drink. enjoy."
V.S.O.J.,4.2,"Dark amber with a half finger of khaki head that quickly settles into a lasting wisp and crown.

Dark caramel, plum, fig, vanilla, oak and a hint of pine in the nose. A decent kiss of alcohol.

Sweet tasting with molasses, dark fruit and vanilla up front, followed by a bitter, pine-and-wood American finish. Fairly boozy.

Full bodied and chewy feel with strong, soft fizz.

Expected this to be overly sweet, but it’s got a fantastic “balance” to it, at least insofar as a hairy, over-the-top brew can be balanced. Great stuff."
V.S.O.J.,4.73,"2024 Version! Sweet brown sugar and molasses malty, bran flakes, toffee candy, dark red plums, and a bourbon barrel nose on this one! Taste follows exactly with a smooth and slightly dry, balanced bourbon barrel boozy finish. This is well-done and a fantastic Barrel Aged barleywine sipper!"
V.S.O.J.,4.71,Yummy.
V.S.O.J.,4.9,"#180, yum!"
Clover,4.34,"Blend 3. Hill review number 100 for me! Definitely leans towards the Flora side of things with a noticeably higher level of lactic and wheat-driven tartness than many of the Hill wine barrel aged offerings. Has that wonderfully complex English muffin-like sweetness from the malts and a decent amount of oaky astringency as well. Really great, but maybe not better than the sum of its component beers

87/100"
Clover,4.26,"375ml waxed and capped bottle into Torst stemware.

Pours a bright goldenrod color. 0.5 finger foamy white head. Little lace with thin legs. Nose is juicy pear, lemon zest, peppercorn, and a spritz and funky barnyard. Moderately aromatic. Beer opens lemon zest, apricot pit, with a slight touch of butter in the back. Funky towards the middle. Hints of bread, yeast, and peppercorn. Tart lemon seed in the finish. Lightly puckering aftertaste. Body is light with ample carbonation. Prickly and lively on the palate and goes down zesty, dry, with a long, lingering aftertaste.

Great complexity though I wish I'd continued to wait a bit before opening this."
Clover,4.96,"Batch 3 bottle poured onsite at Hill Farmstead Brewery in Greensboro Bend, VT.

This one pours a clear golden yellow-ish orange, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This smells like a sort of rustic oak thing, lemon peel, stone fruit, white wine, candied orange, and a dry hay like quality.

This is a blend of Flora, Art, and Ann, so it’s not surprising at all that this is really good. Having had all of those at this point, I wouldn’t say any one beer entirely stands out – this becomes its own thing that stands completely on its own, and might be better than each of the three titans that contributed. It’s very oaky, and orange-like, with a hay-like dry finish that is just so refreshing. There’s also stone fruit, white wine, dried lemon peel, with a restrained and very pleasant acidity.

This is light bodied, clean, lightly and pleasantly tart, and super drinkable.

This is absolutely fantastic, and might just crack the top 5 of Hill Farmstead beers that I’ve had – it’s just such a good and clearly deliberate blend."
Clover,4.7,"Bottle. 2020 edition. At HF brewery.

White head with some lace. Clear golden color.

Such an excellent saison. Definitely has flavors of the base beers. Elegant is a great word for this beer. Drinks like a white wine maybe a Chardonnay. White grapes, oak, green apples, faint saison spice, wheat. Dry and bubbly. Smooth, light, easy drinking. Faint tartness, nice citrus."
Chemtrailmix - Rye Barrel,4.9,"#184, so good!"
Chemtrailmix - Rye Barrel,4.52,"Putting a little pep in your step and numbing the senses all at once, 3 Floyd's pink peppercorn and cinnamon Dark Lord variant takes this Imperial Stout to the nuclear level.... and with snacks.

Jet black and pouring like ink, Chemtrailmix alerts the nose with a strong, savory and sultry blend of coffee, cocoa, whisky, spice, port wine and sherry. As the inky elixir hits the tongue, the taste is enlivened with the sweetness of brown sugar, blackstrap molasses, toffee, honey and caramel with hints of chocolate and condensed fruit.

As the stout extends across the middle palate, the sweetness slowly turns to dry. A rise of espresso, baker's chocolate, roasted nuttiness and campfire char keeps the session hefty before the spices of cinnamon and peppercorn tease the palate with a gentle dry prickle. Trending warm with rye whisky and oak, the late palate trends coconut-like with vanilla, earthen grit and caramel with those savory aged port and sherry savory qualities.

Full bodied, pleasantly chewy and off-cloying, Chemtrailmix finishes malty-dry, spicy and very warm. With impressions of sherry and coconut lingering in aftertaste, this calls for a long, patient and sipping session with high rewards and a surprising rate of drinkability if you can tolerate the combination of whisky and spice."
Chemtrailmix - Rye Barrel,4.74,"Pours a pure, coal black color with a sudsy dark tan head that is fairly quick to flee. The nose features the cinnamon up front and with extreme prejudice - this is bigly cinnamon. There’s also a nice spicy note from the peppercorn and some chocolate and a subtle barrel note.

The barrel is more pronounced on the taste, and a perfect, spicy complement to the peppercorn flavor - and the still bigly cinnamon, which is delicious. There’s also chocolate and a surprising bit of stone fruit. There’s a LOT going on here and it’s all magnificent, IMHO.

The mouthfeel is velvety and coats the mouth properly, commensurate with a beer of this magnitude. What a pleasure it is to finally experience this world class beer."
Chemtrailmix - Rye Barrel,4.52,2020 version poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter. Heavy cinnamon on the nose and in the flavor with a mild spice. Nicely thick. A little chocolate and barrel mixed in. Happy to finally try this.

Fou' Foune,4.86,"The amazing aspect of Fou'Foune is how delicate the balance and flavor profile is, yet the flavor is also complex and robust. A beautiful contradiction! Fou'Foune pours light gold with a modest pure white head. Fruit forward in the nose, and lively and effervescent like champagne on the tongue. Flavor tiptoes up the the line of tartness, then backs off and is replaced by sweetness. Apricot and citrus doing the tango on your palette. Savor this."

Fou' Foune,5.0,"Bottled in 2016

A: Poured into a tulip glass to a light golden yellow beer which is topped by a dense and fluffy finger and a half of white head which fades slowly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing
S: Smells of apricots, hints of sourness, some chalky yeast and a touch of funk
T: Taste is building sourness up front with some nice apricot notes followed by some nice funk. Sourness is under control and not too aggressive with more apricots and more funk with some pale malty flavors coming through as well. On the finish there's some lemony tartness, more apricot, some lingering funk and a touch of chalky yeast.
M: This beer has a body which is on the lighter side of medium. Carbonation is lightly effervescent while the beer has a drying finish due to the acidity.
O: Overall this beer is outstanding. Great flavors and complexity. I probably should have drank this one sooner but it still tastes fantastic."
Very Green,4.6,"Gifted a can from Drew. Huge full fruit forward DNEIPA. Massive. Thought the look was a bit too full and a bit murky. But this was as advertised. A huge “in your face” bomb of flavor full of pineapple, orange and resin. The thick dense white head fits with the heavy punch of this beer. The nose is citrus, sweetness and dank.
Overall it is delicious brew that brings a green dank that tempers the fruit and sharpens the mouthfeel. Very glad I had a chance to try this one. Wow.
Body is full and creamy."
Very Green,4.65,"L - very hazy, opaque, creamy straw with a creamy white head that dissipates somewhat quickly, leaving behind a good amount of lacing
S - tons of pineapple, fresh piney bitter hops, some citrus and papaya. Some cracker malt as well
T - fresh, piney, grassy, bitter hops intermixed well with tropical fruit notes - pineapple, citrus. Some floral notes. A solid amount of malt to tie things together. Slight caramel.
F - medium leaning on full bodied with moderate carbonation. Soft. Looks like it will be more heavier than it is. Slightly heavier than Green.
O - a truly solid NEIPA that actually lets fresh hops shine, even if they are slightly toned down compared to the original Green"
Very Green,4.89,One of the best ive ever had !!

t: caramelized oranges and guava upfront. peach, sweet pineapple, and tangerines follow. behind that is cantaloupe and a touch of chalky hops. orange juice and some generic sweet melon

m: medium mouthfeel, with low carbonation - yet quite fluffy and chewy

o: quite a nice beer. great hop harmonization and dangerous for the abv. typical Tree House excellence of hazy hops, my only critique is this one seems a bit chalky"
Very Green,4.85,"This is it. This is the stuff. Beautiful yellow in the glass. Ripe pineapple, sweet mango and papaya. Assertive pithy bitterness on the back end and finish. Epitome of my kind of hazy. Only thing I'd prefer is a bit more juice on the nose.

Tasted great, not overly boozy but enough to appreciate. Thick and sorta almost chalky in a positive way. Chocolate - not too dark or mild.

Assassin,5.0,"I had the pleasure of sharing the 2023 variety with a friend. Easily the best, beer especially stout, I’ve ever had. This puts those other mass produced, thin barrel stouts to shame.

Wonderfully thick full-flavored mouthfeel. Coconut."
Very GGGreennn,4.3,"Good solid IPA, definitely some hop burn here compared to most NEIPA/hazies. Very opaque thick orangish light amber color with a lasting white froth of foam. It definitely has some tropical citric goodness expected of a hazy here, but even more prevalent is a spicy hop character with a vegetal herbal component. I would venture as far as to say that while most hazies are hazy in the tropical sense, this one is hazy in the hop bite spice floral herb sense. Very gggreen indeed."

Very GGGreennn,4.62,"Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Buddy the elf what's your favorite color? Canned 12/20/2023.

Frothy and creamy forming head, four to easily three fingers tall of rich off white lather. Pill and ring lacing forming on a good slow sinking head, with lots of staying power. Creamed and turbid looking body, a little custard yellow with touches of brown.

Fantastic hop aroma. Perfume like tropical notes of pineapple and mango, a faint touch of caramel malt, lemon to lime citrus oil, and some faint smokey earth. Excellent nose that just whaffs of perfumed fruit bonanza.

Shocking palate. Classic and bold rich pineapple and juiced fruit in the mid palate, almost sillky like in feel. But it's the finish that is the real winner and shocker of a surprise. Ending and finish is full of a rich first mint, then bitter marmalade heat that just builds ever so slowly with the perfect amount of oily creep that hits out of nowhere. Litteraly juiced herbs is the only way I can describe it, and the sensation is phenomenal. Earth and mint perfume finish with matching tropical hop fruit.

Real crazy make up here and unlike anything I have had in the IPA realm in a long time. Very special beer."

F - Medium body and carbonation with soft mouthfeel.
O - Outstanding New England IPA."
Very GGGreennn,4.74,"Pours completely opaque yellow orange with a thick head that holds its shape like steamed milk. Smell is unmistakably Green. Taste is very pineapple forward. Regular Green has this too, but it's much more prominent in VGgg. The bitterness is stronger than I remember, which is good - my one criticism the last time I had this was that it was a touch too sweet for my taste. Mouthfeel is typical for a Treehouse DIPA.

An outstanding beer."
Anabasis,4.29,"Murky brown in color with minimal light penetration. There's a fingernail of dark brown around the rim. I'm smelling lots of toffee and caramel. I'm tasting toffee, dark malt, bourbon, and vanilla. The mouth is dry, boozy, and sticky."

I expected this to be SUPER thick and opaque like a Medianoche. It wasn't. Could see through it a bit during the pour. Smelled great. Some coconut there for sure and coffee. Not much vanilla. Flavor was a bit different. More coffee in the sip with subtle vanilla and some coconut. Expected more coconut. Feel was quite viscous considering how the pour looked. Mouth coating.

Flavor: Strong flavors of grapefruit, lemon, circus shine, and pine. Bitter and clean on the finish. (4.25)

Feel: Medium body, strong creation, finishes strongly, better and clean. (4.50)

Compared to Swami's Pizza Port 8/24: Pours similar, milder head. Stronger aromas. Similar flavors, but strong and more bitter. Similar. Winner: Pliny

Overall: I've had this on tap, but actually my first time formally reviewing it. Strong aromas. Backs it up with the flavor. Excellent mouthfeel that is soft, smooth, yet balanced by an incredible bitterness. It's at three months so I wasn't sure how it was going to hold up. Deserves the hype."
Pliny The Elder,4.57,Draught
Pliny The Elder,4.75,"Draft at Hot Monk on Sonoma, CA!"
Pliny The Elder,4.64,"Quite simply the real champagne of beers. It pours a light orange-gold with a nice finger of head and good lacing that hangs around. The aroma is nice, a pleasant tropical hop medley but not super strong. The taste is, well, pretty close to perfect. There are maybe 3 hoppy ales I’d rate over this and this one is right there. The aforementioned tropical flavors, pineapple, mango, guava, grapefruit, and a the right amount of malt to hold it together. It’s pretty dry, more bitter than you realize at first, and oh so smooth. I’ll buy this beer every time I see it, cheers!"
Pliny The Elder,4.88,"Champagne like high from an IPA, clear to see through, easy to drink, hits hard. Great floral notes that don't wreck your palate. Best if consumed within 2 weeks of bottling."
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.74,"Pours a pitch black - motor oil and shiny, huge pillow of caramel head that leaves a sudsy pancake batter on the side of the glass. Nice stick and retention throughout. Coffee, Caramel, Toffee, bourbon, chocolate all prominent on the nose - very inviting and is a segway for what is to come. Layers of flavor - chocolate, coffee, bread dough, some boozey notes, warms your soul.

World class beer that should be a nice sipper that is hard to sip because it is so damn tasty."
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.41,"The colour is very dark, almost black. Basically, this beer resembles a tarry liquid. Dark brown foam, after a while it changes colour to a slightly lighter brown. Medium-high, moderately persistent. Melts to a thin dross, coating the walls of the glass.
The aroma is decidedly sweet, there is coffee, chocolate, strong notes of maple syrup, hints of Bourbon and barrel. There's a subtle vanilla, lightly coconut, some dark fruit and gently burnt caramel.
Taste: It's sweet, we have chocolate, sweet coffee, maple syrup, plum marmalade, light hints of vanilla, coconut and gentle Bourbon inclusions. All the flavour components work very nicely together to create an incredibly cohesive whole. The finish is bolstered by a roasted bitterness, not too high and short.The gently warming alcohol reminds us that this is a strong beer and that it can fuck up.
Saturation low, as it should be. The beer has an incredibly soft, smooth and velvety texture.

CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),5.0,I have traveled the world and tasted lots of beer. This is my new favorite
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.15,"L: Dark brown body, half finger head
S: Rich and sweet. Dark chocolate, caramel, vanilla, maple notes, bourbon.
T: Follows the nose. Bourbon upfront, quickly becoming sweet caramel and chocolate, well defined nuttiness in the body, more bourbon, a few coffee notes, and a lovely roasty, almost smokey maple finish.
F: Becomes quite warm half way through the sip, and finishes very smooth.
O: Finally got to try this classic. Not disappointed; I can see how it has influenced the style. That said, personally, as is often the case, a bit cloying for me."
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.49,"2017 Vintage. Pours near black with a robust 2"" head that settles to a solid cocoa cap, thin streaks of lacing. Nose is coffee grounds, cocoa, baking chocolate, roasted barley and malt; very light barrel and maple at this point. As it warms, a little more maple character, along with some light soy. Taste remains well balanced even after 6+ years - maple sweetness, malt/roast, tannic barrel; cola-like citrus sweetness. Remarkable how well this has held up. Feel is light for the ABV and compared to other adjunct stouts. Having had so many imitators, was expecting the original to pale in comparison; instead, it not only held up, but surpassed the competition."
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.58,"2018 vintage, review from my untappd"
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.23,"Appearance: Pours a completely dark color with a massive dark tan head that pillows and lingers. (4.25)

Aroma: Strong aromas of cocoa, coffee, bittersweet notes upfront. Balanced and complex. (4.25)

Flavor: Strong flavors of cocoa and chocolate upfront that balance with coffee. Then a sweet and rich chocolate, bourbon, and maple flavor follow. Sweet with a mild coffee roast off the finish. (4.25)

Feel: Heavier-bodied, strong carbonation. Mild roast. Smooth, heavy, but balanced and not too sweet. (4.00)

Overall: First try at this World-Class rated Stout. Founders doesn't make bad ones so have high expectations. The pour is beautiful. Aromas are spot on. Chocolate, coffee, yet with a complexity you can't describe. Backs it up on the flavor with the addition of some maple, honey, and bourbon sweetness. Still complex with a balanced finish. Not sure why they held this one back and why it's not easy to find, but this could easily be an annual release. I've learned to try every stout from Founders without question. (Rating: 4.23)"
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.62,"Deep, rich pour. Nose is maple and bourbon, chocolate. First sip brings up the coffee and bourbon, dark chocolate follows close behind. Long finish. It's beer heaven."
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.64,I always find it hard to believe they can make this taste aged when it's freshly bottled. Years ago the maple would be strong unless you waited on it. The last few years the maple is perfectly blended. Magical...
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),5.0,I don't know what to say about this vmbeer that isn't already known. Founders makes some amazing stouts and this is one of their best. I cannot recommend it enough.
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.88,"This is sublime. I lack the experience or vocabulary to call myself a connoisseur or expert rater of beers, but at the moment I’m drinking this, it could be the most delicious beer I’ve ever had, even better than the Belgian quads I love so much. And when you get right down to it, any beer — or any food, any experience — that is this transcendentally satisfying deserves to be thought of as one of the best."
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.5,"Pours a deep brown with ample tan head. It smell like chocolate, dark malts, maple. The taste is chocolate, maple, a little coffee, some wood, barrel, a little dry with some hops.
One of my favorite beers and certainly stouts and it is a smooth beverage that is dangerous drinkable, cheers!"
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.67,"This is a 2018 vintage bottle.

Pours opaque dark brown to black but with red and amber highlights on the edges when held up to light. Hefty khaki head that persists, falls to a modest cap, but foam coats the glass beautifully.

The aroma is great, but maybe subdued by age. Coffee and sweet chocolate, bourbon barrel and vanilla, base stout and very faint maple as if warms up.

Taste - coffee, chocolate on the sweeter side, just a touch of bourbon, some vanilla and the maple shows up late but blends jn smoothly. All on top of roasty base grains and the OG stout. Superb, smoothly integrated.

Feel is thick but not syrupy or sticky. It's not highly carbonated. Luxurious and smooth.

Tremendous beer - not much more thst one can say about it."
10 Year Barleywine,4.94,"Should be near the top of the 250 list. The gold standard of BA Barleywines begins with this one. At 17% abv, the booze is well hidden beneath layers of toffee, leather and barrel."
Westly,3.53,"Great late summer beer thanks to the copious presence of apricots, especially in the aromas. Looks and tastes like your standard American wild ale: lambic-like, acetic, and not particularly well balanced in terms of allowing the local terroir to shine

71/100"
Westly,3.77,"Very acidic. Subtle apricot. Based on this vintage, I prefer WA."
Westly,4.26,"Sample at de Garde 10th Anniversary. Cloudy golden pour, small bubbly head. Aroma is stone fruit and grapes. Taste is fruity, tart with lots of funk and barrel notes."
Westly,4.36,Fantastic golden hue and white foam head that emits a fresh apricot orchard like aroma. The aroma is a burst of freshly cut apricots and a hint of funk. Flavor is initially the fresh apricot flavor that's mostly sweet with tartness coming in behind it. The finish though is overwhelmingly sour. Great overall but acidity is strong with this one which detracts a bit from the sweet apricot fruit like notes I enjoy most.
Abner,4.56,"On tap at Sabatinis in Exeter pa late this afternoon.

Splendid looking beer. Faintly hazy golden body. Strong persistent white head, which leaves spectacular lacing. Aroma is hoppy, fruity, mostly non citrus. On tasting, at times sweet, other times bitter. Strongly hoppy, but rests on a solid malt base. The abv at first isn't that noticable, but it sneaks up on you. Finish is warming. Mouth is full.

Overall, an outstanding drink. Only a long drive home prevents me from having another 2 or 3."
Abner,4.23,"Pours a light copper color with a finger of head. The nose has citrus notes upfront with some pine in the background. The flavor profile has bright citrus notes. Oranges are predominant with a trace of lemon as a nice accent. The body is a bit light for a big IPA.

This is quite good, but I'm not sure it lives up to the hype."
Abner,4.5,"From brewery - canned October 2/23 - 6 days old.
Uniformly hazy burnt to brownish orange golden colour with a half finger of short lived just slightly off white head.
Nose is floral, some honey like malt; strong citrus notes - orange, red grapefruit - soft tropical fruit (mango mainly) with a hint of vanilla and piney resin. At one point questioned a bit of soapiness.
Sweet citrus on the palate - orange, but also a good whack of pithy grapefruit, some grapefruit peel bitterness coating the back of the mouth admixing with piney resin flavours.
Creamy and smooth, rich full mouthfeel - carbonation brightly pushes throughout the body - pithy bitterness lingers with the juicy sweetness."
Abner,4.59,"Such a well balanced beer. Hill Farmstead doesn't go crazy with one flavor profile and that is embodied here. While labeled a NE IPA, is more caramel colored than hazy and tastes blend west coast and east coast styles, similar to Focal Banger. Definitely hoppy at the start but mellows with a malty, oaty finish. Partly hoppy and partly rustic, Abner is a expertly minimalist IPA. They do all the little things right."
Double Sunshine,4.42,"6/25/25 FINALLY! On tap at THE Lawson's brewhouse.

Beautiful citrus overtones. Vanilla, peach, and soft lemon aromas.

Amazingly smooth, bitter, slightly sweet. Vanilla, stone fruit, lemon rind, and grapefruit.

Listening to smooth blues on a cool summer evening!"
Double Sunshine,4.72,"Double Sunshine.

The beer. The myth. The legend.

The beer that spawned an entire series of Sunshine-themed (mostly) IPAs.

Sip of Sunshine is one of the best shelf-available IPAs in the nation. Little Sip packs one heck of a punch for the ABV. Triple Sunshine is a legend in its own right. And on and on and on, each take fantastic in its own right.

But Double Sunshine is really the OG.

The flavor profile leans citrus-forward, but there's a hefty amount of pine, resin, and tropical fruit to provide balance. The malt base is clean and smooth. You'd likely never guess that both DS and SoS clock in at an identical 8% ABV; while the latter drinks like a single IPA (that will knock you on your ass), the former truly drinks like an imperial IPA.

Double Sunshine is one of the purest expressions of an Imperial IPA - before the NE-style craze, but not aspiring to be a Pliny clone, either. Entirely worthy of the hype, and then perhaps some."
Double Sunshine,4.57,"On tap at Sabatinis in Exeter pa early this evening.

Lovely bright golden body. Head gradually shrinks to a fat collar and covering. Magnificent rings of lacing. Aroma is hoppy, mildly tropical. On tasting, initially slightly sweet, then a massive grapefruit assault
Quite bitter. Loving this. Finish a lasting dry grapefruit bitterness. Mouth is full.

Overall. Been hoping for this one, and it did not disappoint. 1/2 barrel tapped 4 hours ago."
Double Sunshine,4.76,"Poured into a Spiegelau from a 16 oz can.

Look: Vibrant yellow-orange with a slight amber hue. Rocky, foamy white head with significant lacing.

Smell: Hop punch up front with juicy, tropical aromas muddling in. Slight vanilla and maple syrup at the end.

Taste: Hop explosion. Citrus up front with an almost creamy quality, quickly followed by a classic IPA hop bite.

Feel: Incredibly smooth. A light prickle on the tongue with a creamy mouthfeel and finish.

Overall: A terrific double NEIPA. Truly excellent."
Double Sunshine,4.69,"Poured from the can into a Lawson's branded tulip/goblet glass. Canned April 26th 2023.

Beamin juicy orange colored body, with a touch of haze and light visible carbonation. Three finger forming head, a bit of soapy and big bubbled appearance which pops easily, with light retention. Still manages to stick around and leave a tall collar as well, making a nice crowned appearance.

Delicious aroma. Hop pressing front nose with light citrus, and faint touching juicy tropical notes. A nice creamy touch almost sweet vanilla, mixing with a light caramel and crispy malt quality. Comes off like hinting of light powdered sugar on fruity pancakes quality.

The mouthfeel on this is just unreal. An intense solid backbone that is creamy with just a light touch of pushing sweet tones on the palate. The mid hits with thick THICK controlled orange and pine notes, mixing sweet cream and orange, and pine/earth heat. Bitterness comes in the finish, so ever slowly, with first notes of tangerine and Christmas spices, then with lingering notes of pepper and wood bitterness. Campfire like warmth in the back palate, that just slowly sits and churns with all the orange and spices you can imagine.

Fantastic IPA, and hardly any hint of big abv now that I think of it. Just killer stuff."
JJJuliusss,4.45,"i know these guys have expanded a lot in recent years, so these arent quite as ungettable as they once were, but its still so sick to get to drink through a bunch of these special ones i never thought id have the chance to try, and this one is as advertised, a crazy ramped up version of the original julius and still recognizable as such, but beefed up in every way. the pour is pretty still, but its really hazy and dense, not quite with visible sediment, but definitely with a grain stew look about it, high creamy white head from the sexy pint can, a deep orange color to this with very low glow. the aroma is epic, mandarin oranges from the can, peak juiciness, along with ripe mango, tangerine, and cut flowers, slightly herbal, low bitterness, subtle white grapefruit, quince, and even vanilla, exceedingly fresh and appealing, maybe faintly yeasty but in a way that works with all the other elements, not at all distracting. the flavor is killer too, saturated to the max without being forced and without having harshness, which is such a tough line to walk, but its done masterfully here, they have a formula and its safe to say it works and is working. seems like citra on steroids, like on the edge of irresponsible, and there is a major fresh squeezed orange juice thing going on with a little lemongrass there too, not sure what hops are actually at work here, likely a couple of varietals anyway, but its a lovely mix. some juicy nectarine, white wine grape, and candy-like new school sativa here, some oils staying on the tongue past the swallow but not too green and hardly bitter at all for how hop driven it is. i also think its cool that the alcohol is held back, usually at this hop intensity these are doubles or imperials, so i appreciate the drink a few of them strength, although this is still a pretty filling brew and a big commitment for the palate, if not the blood alcohol level this time. soft feeling and holding and extending the hop climax beyond just about any ipa type ive ever had, its at max for a long time, epic. light coconut, pineapple, and general tropical warmth as it sits, juicy and delicious as can be. perhaps just a bit more grain to this than i need in the mouthfeel, but its hard to be critical at all of a beer this good, ideal freshness in my experience too, thankful for the family friend who stoked our beer fridge with tree house gems, this one was memorable!"
JJJuliusss,4.63,"From a week-old can, pours a hazy deep, rich orange. Big dense head of foam. Smell starts with a blast of orange citrus, then develops into tropical fruits and a touch of resin. Taste follows. Smooth, rich feel that you'd normally expect in a IIPA. Exceptional."
Framboise Du Fermier,4.2,"750ml capped bottle into a Side Project snifter.

Pours a slightly cloudy ruby red. Spotty and stringy lace with a 0.5 finger coarse, white head. Nose is raspberry jam, oak, and a juicy sweetness. Lightly funky. Beer opens lightly acidic. Seedy raspberry. Light lemon zest, clean, lightly plastic funk. Juicy in the middle, accented tartness in the finish. Filmy, puckering finish. Body is light with ample carbonation. Prickly on the palate and goes down sticky, accented. Long, messy finish.

Clean, juicy, and plenty funky. This is really nice."
Framboise Du Fermier,4.66,"L - reddish orange with golden hues and an off-white head that dissipates quickly leaving behind no real lacing
S - bright raspberry, Brett funk, some lactose, oak, floral notes
T - bright raspberries up front and throughout with Brett funk, oak, lactose,
F - light bodied with high carbonation, tart
O - better than peche in my opinion, but it's close"
Dinner,4.91,"9/3/2024, on tap at Apothecary Ale House

At long last someone finally had this, and what better place?

Gorgeous opaque straw in color. Very tight rim of right bubbles which leave the glass dappled white.

Aroma - sweet sunshine in a glass. Apricot, pineapple, and tangerine. A hint of lemon peel and cedar along with a soft maltiness.

Taste - agreed, perfect. Bright on the tongue, sweet pineapple, lemony zing, and a beautiful bitter grapefruit finish. Not sweet in any way to distract (in my opinion) from this wonderful offering!"
Dinner,4.75,Thank you Uncle Jeff!
Dinner,4.5,07/21/24 draft @ FlipSide Hudson
Dinner,4.29,"Served on tap in a pint glass
Appearance – The beer is served a hazy orange-yellow color with a small head of white foam. The head fades over a moderate level of time, leaving a touch of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is strong of tropical fruit smells of pineapple, mango, and papaya, along with a good showing of orange and tangerine. Other smells of a bready and doughy smell mixed with some light spice and some notes of pepper and lemon are there as well, mixed with some notes of melon and a good showing of pine and herb.
Taste - The taste begins similar to the nose, with flavors of a bready malt mixed with some flavors of tropical fruit of mango, pineapple and tangerine. The hop is present right from the start, heaviest in pine and herb, but containing notes of a grapefruit and floral hop as well. As the taste advances a bit of wood and some light notes of grass, vanilla, and hay join in, all while the malt and the hop grow a bit stronger, leaving one with a rather nicely hopped and somewhat more malty taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is on the slightly chewier and thick side with a moderate level of carbonation. For the style and the tastes, the feel is nice and makes for a dangerously easy sipper.
Overall – A rather nice imperial hazy. Big flavor, but good balance. Not as spectacular as the reviews may suggest, but overall quite good and well crafted.

Update: 6/26/24
Had this from the bottle as well. Born on date of 05/21/24 so only 36 days old. Very similar to the brew above. Good solid brew."
Dinner,2.99,"Quality brewer but this one did not work for me at all. Very course and not all the good stuff offered in IPAs today. I've enjoyed some imperials but this one falls in the ""too much for me category""."
Dinner,4.5,"Picked-up two bottles at Maine Beer Company in Freeport for nine dollars. My eighth brew from these guys. Bottled on date of 11/7/23. Very good, very expensive."
Dinner,4.63,"Not sure how I never rated this one previously, but just as good as the other times I've tried it after all these years. Pretty phenomenal across the board from the beautiful clear golden pour, to impeccable balance, to smooth drinkability and a super clean finish. It's a work of art."
Duck Duck Gooze,4.34,"Hazy goldenrod with leggy white film; flowers, candles, canary melon rind and white grape on the nose; biscuit, honeycomb, white balsamic, light oaky vanilla, horse blanket, a hint of honeysuckle, and vague barrel; light, spritzy, dry.

4 4.25 4.5 4.25 4.25

Bright and flowery, with a piquant thread of lemon zest. A bit heavier and woodier than a Belgian version would be. The only thing missing that I can notice is any effect from using red wine barrels.
This is a proper gueuze. Did it benefit from hitting the market back when 3F and Cantillon were extremely hard to come by? Yes. Is it still worth chasing? Also, yes.
Lovely, though I’d be more impressed with it if I hadn’t ever had a bunch of good Brussels sours.

Earns its reputation - especially in isolation."
Duck Duck Gooze,4.66,"(750 ml corked caged bottle, dusty, 2022 vintage, 'ale aged in red wine barrels'; purchased off shelf at The Sanctuary in San Marcos two days ago... decanted into a stemless wine glass)

L: clear, yellow-gold liquid: fizzy, yellow-tinged foam on the pour, threatening to spill over but quickly settling into a thin, fuzzy cap... the foam eventually cracks, but I did get some thick splotches of lace... gets a little cloudier the more it's poured out

S: lemon meringue pie, key lime pie crust, the bready and doughiness of which takes a moment to blossom, but then matches the potency of the funk, while nutty yeast and barrel wood eventually accents the edges... fairly textbook aromas, but certainly an overtone of citrus-kissed floral honey

T: pop of bright, perky tartness upon initial contact swiftly trailed by crackery, grainy malt; just pummels the palate from the outset... settles into a cocktail of these dominant flavors, taking on a Bee's Knees vibe... aftertaste is a dry, tart lemon-honey cough drop thing

F: pinging, puckering bite up front, quickly followed by silky, slow, near slimy malt nectar... the legs and residual drag in the finish never abates, start to finish

O: while it arguably lacks a unique, exotice signature, it's overall pretty damn superb: blending and especially intensity... damn 'fresh' for a gueuze... bit of a hefty price tag, but two sips in I knew I was paying for high quality (2274)"
Duck Duck Gooze,4.1,fobab 2022.
Duck Duck Gooze,4.55,"2019 vintage

Appearance: Pours a cloudy apricot with a one finger head that leaves some streaky lacing as it reduces to a film

Smell: Tart lemon, green apple, white wine grape and oak, layered with some barnyard funk

Taste: Tart lemon forward with white wine grape and green apple rounding out the lactic parade; oak and barnyard funk, through the middle, with a sour yogurt finish

Mouthfeel: Light to medium body with moderate carbonation; puckery

Overall: Long time want and glad to finally get a chance to taste this; lives up to its billing"
Duck Duck Gooze,4.55,"At long last! It was always scandalous to me that the top rated gueuze on this site was from outside belgium, and while I still feel this is not the best gueuze I have ever had, I can now see why it is in that echelon of the style. Cloudy yellow pour, finger of sudsy white foam, good mix of spotted and splotchy lacing. Lemon, sliced tart apple, lacto, barnyard funk, white grape, flowers, hay and earthy oak in the potent nose. Taste is just as potent, but not as complex as the sour notes lead more than the barnyard funk, oak backs the sour fruits well, slight earth, yogurt funk, and decent hay round out. A more sunny disposition for the style, leans sour more than funky but both present in spades, but the body is light and nuanced despite the potency. I would love to age a bottle of this as I think it would age really nicely!"
Lou Pepe - Kriek,4.59,2014 vintage tasted in 2024 at Cantillon: made friends during a tour of Cantillon and had an impromptu bottle share. Someone bought a bottle of 10 year old Lou Pepe - Kriek to share. Unreal to have had this experience.
Lou Pepe - Kriek,4.89,"2018
Bottled: 14 September 2020
Reviewed: 24 December 2023

A: Pours a crystal clear deep, dark ruby with a large dark pink head that dissipates quickly until it looks almost still. When the head dissipates it almost looks like a medium body red wine in color, like a pinot noir or chianti. 4.5

S: Aroma is lovely with very strong dark berry notes and substantial plastic like funk. There is a huge bing cherry character, balancing notable citrus sourness. 4.75

T: Taste is very sour, probably the most puckering sourness I’ve ever experienced in a beer. Outright impressive. These sour notes are balanced by a very nice red fruit palate bouquet, lead by of course cherry characteristics. There is a big clean minerality and some smoothly oaky notes. Essentially perfect. 5

M/D: Lighter side of medium bodied with a nice bright, crispy carbonation, and a great drinkability. 4.75

O: Truly an elite beer. In the discuss for best I’ve ever had. 5"
Lou Pepe - Kriek,4.93,"750ml bottle at share. Cranberry pour, wispy off-white head. Tart cherry aroma. Taste starts with a big pucker, lots of sour cherries, fruity, wine-like. So rich, so full. Definitely worthy of it's high rating. Honored to get to finally try this."
Lou Pepe - Kriek,4.94,"Seeing the tape get pulled off the menu listing for the 2020 bottle at the Cantillon bar definitely got the old heart pumping. As the freshly, horizontally uncorked bottle rested in its lambic basket, it began to slowly push a soft mauve foam out of the spout before I gave it a tilt to pour a damn near smoothie-like stream into the glass. There it displays fully opaque garnet with a dense cotton candy head.

I said St. Lam was the juiciest Loon? Scratch that, this is like Schaerbeek puree with mild hints of cinnamon marzipan delivered on a pillowy body with a surprisingly balanced acidity. Even still, a complex oak tannin brings us to a bone dry finish before exhaling a touch of black pepper and perhaps chevre. A delicious candied quality further emerges as it warms.

I'm not sure I ever imagined just what made LPK the highly coveted fruited lambic that it is, but clearly, that distinguisher is decadence. This is undoubtedly the thickest lambic I've ever had, and in all the most delicious ways."
Lou Pepe - Kriek,4.64,"Cradled 750mL bottle served in decanter, sat for ~20 minutes, then served into glass. Pours a rich burgundy color with a finger of pink foam. Aroma is cherry forward, but not in a fleshy, fruit forward way, instead delivering a rindy dark pit. It's morphs into notes of almond and cinnamon, with light tart cherry and stone just beyond. Complexity is notable, without any overtly sugary tendencies. Flavor profile delivers those same almond and cinnamon notes. Cherry is present, with a tart twist. Stone, followed by big lemon zest and grassy notes play the outro. Again, the complexity and depth is just amazing. For a beer blended with cherries, it develops much more nuance and thought beyond this single note. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a consistent grit throughout. It verges on bubbly, at least at the onset. Overall, cherry notes here are just a delight, swirling together with almond and cinnamon for a thought provoking sip. It refrains from every dipping into overtly tart or sour.

2018. Served from a 750mL bottle. Decanted. Reviewed from notes."
Morning Wood,4.64,"Had at Funky Buddha on Nov 5, 2018. Review from my Untappd

WOW. Thsi could easily be a 4.75+ if I tasted some of the bacon, but none of that. Again. Spectacular beer. Also - nitro, for what it's worth."
Morning Wood,4.47,"2017 vintage

Beer 1400!!! I purposely saved this one for this landmark review since I reviewed the base version and the imperial version a few weeks back. This has been a long time want of mine, and luckily I was able to get the whole series at once. This bourbon barrel-aged variant has been sitting at the highest rated Imperial Porter for a long time on BA, and #38 overall. Let’s see if it lives up to the hype

Pours a very dark brown with a finger of creamy dark tan head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

The bourbon is definitely present in the nose, making the whole thing quite a bit sweeter but still really good. I’m picking up on aromas of sweet bourbon, charred oak, salty bacon, medium roast coffee, milk chocolate, maple syrup, burnt caramel, and light brown sugar

It’s an absolute smack in the face of every single element in taste, wow. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting smoky bacon, milk chocolate, maple candy, sweetened coffee, sweet bourbon, raisin, toasted oak, creamy vanilla, and caramel. The swallow brings notes of salty bacon, charred oak, dark chocolate, medium roast coffee, burnt caramel, brown sugar, maple syrup, smoked malt, and vanilla

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a smooth and silky beer. Finishes mostly dry with a warming alcohol presence

Man, it’s been so much fun trying my way through this series. This one is the clear winner. I hope I get a chance to try them all fresh one day"
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout - Double Barrel Reserve,4.75,Shared 12oz bottle opened at Toppling Goliath during 2024 Morning Delight release. Booze in the aroma. Not quite as thick as regular KBBS (or Morning Delight for that matter). The same amount of coffee but less maple than regular KBBS. Fabulous nonetheless.
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout - Double Barrel Reserve,5.0,"Dark brown/black oily appearance, very little head that recedes quickly to a collar, and oily fingers. Roasted coffee, natural maple, and smooth bourbon barrel notes, all so integrated and well balanced. Moderate thick body, mild to moderate carbonation, smooth textured mouthfeel. Well done build on regular KBBS."
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout - Double Barrel Reserve,4.82,"Officially my final beer of the top 250 list!

Pours mostly black, with a slight brown edges. Essentially no head, but beautiful legs coat the glass!

The aroma explodes with huge notes of maple in the forefront! Bourbon soaked coffee beans follow in a big way! Just massive waves of toasted oak, sweet caramel, and hints of coconut. The barrel notes are tremendous, and the adjuncts fill in beautifully!

The taste does not disappoint! It follows all of the notes from the nose almost to a T! Extremely maple forward, but the bourbon and coffee cut the sweetness beautifully! Touches of burnt oak and coconut balance things out well. A slight bitterness from the coffee was a pleasant surprise.Delightful!

Medium bodied, yet nicely mouth coating. Incredibly smooth and round, with only a touch of booze. A surprisingly dry finish that keeps you coming back for more.

This beer was tremendous, and I'm so happy I got to have this as my final beer on the top 250 list! While I didn't rate the taste and feel quite so high I don't know what I'd change in this beer, so I'm giving the overall a 5!"

Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.87,"This bottle was a gift from a coworker who obtained a case while visiting the brewery. Date on the cap: 26.10.20 (26-Oct-2020), indicating it was bottled 26-Oct-2017. It has been in my cellar for around 6 years. Poured cold into a tulip.

L: Cracking the cap releases a strong hiss. Muddy dark brown brew. Frothy carbonation dissipates quickly. Bubbles line the glass.

S: Roasty malt, candied cherries, dry caramel.

T: Candied cherries. Candied cherries. Candied cherries. There are other minor things going on, but candied cherries is the dominant impression. Some tart notes like Smarties candy. Definitely fortified by candi sugar. A dash of hot cinnamon. Anchored by minor base notes of warm cocoa and yeast atop a moderate base of grain.

M: Thin and a bit fizzy, but it goes down very smooth. The abv is masked very well. Finishes with a prominent tart candi sweetness that lingers quite a long time.

O: There are a lot of classic flavors in here that I haven't enjoyed in a long time. I dunno what has happened in the brewing world over the past decade, but this is"

Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),3.94,"First time I had this was in 2020 when by buddy shared with me. Last time I had this was in Brussels this year. It is a good beer, but I think its exclusivity is what makes it so desirable and highly rated."
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.87,"Trappist Westvletteren 12

L: Beautiful reddish brown color

S: Such a subtle sweet smell. A bit of apples, but not your regular cider like apples. A bit of burnt sugar in smell.

T is as great as smell. Very gentle, sweet, deep, and dry at the same time. Like a great jerez.

F: Very easy to drink for the amount of alcohol. Aftertaste of a cola lollipop, very pleasant.

O: Probably the best beer I tried. Unique. Now I see why it has 100/100. After hesitation, I ordered it in Hops and dreams in Seville to celebrate my marathon pb. A perfect end to a fantastic day."
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.61,"Clear and yet very dark brown body, opaque in the glass; head pours out fizzy but stabilizes to nice 1 1/2 finger thick head, light khaki colored. Fantastic aroma of brown and candi sugars; brownies; roasted nuts; mildly perky spiciness augments all the other smells. Stupendous flavors; deep caramel and nougat notes; honey; brown sugar; a bit of boozy undertone; no real bitterness per se, more of a phenol bite.

I never expected to have this beer, yet here it is. The depth and complexity is outstanding. More tones and nuances emerge as the beer warms up such as roasted nuts and chocolate. This is a truly outstanding beer based solely on the taste, a masterful bit of brewing art.

Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.21,"Gushed a bit when I got opened the bottle. I hope the carb is intact.

It's a murky dark brown color, bordering on black at its darkest point, but the highlights are a lighter shade brown rather than ruby. It's like the color of banana bread crust.
Not much visible carbonation in the glass. The head is small, beige, creamy, and patchy. The head doesn't seem to dissipate at all; it was just never that big to begin with. But it's sticky, latte-like froth, and swirly.
Upon further swirls, it generates a larger head that stays.

Alcohol tickles my nostrils immediately with warmth. Prune and fig stands out, dried cherry and raisin, allspice, clove, and hay. A bit of overripe banana, banana bread, some type of woodsy bark, perhaps oak and tannins. Gives off red wine vibes. Upon another whiff and thought, huge tobacco aroma, with perhaps a touch of vanilla. There's some sweet caramel and toffee or butterscotch that melds seamlessly with dark brown bread and banana. Think of it as dried and musty stone fruit trail mix in a cigar humidor with baking supplies. It smells like it's from a cellar. Amazing. Perhaps it's the power of suggestion, but it smells like it came from a monastery.

The taste is more subdued than the nose. Interesting. It tastes very strong and almost boozy. It tastes like bourbon soaked raisin, banana bread, some prune, and large amounts of clove and pepper. Some hay and oak tannins. The alcohol warmth takes over the palate and lingers with heat.

The mouthfeel is smooth, silky, creamy. It coats the palate. The carbonation isn't extremely high compared to other Belgians, but it moves the beer on the palate nonetheless. The palate is left feeling sticky with some residuals sugar and ethanol, though not overly so. It's not cloying at all. Dries off quite a bit. The alcohol taste lingers.

Overall? Well, of course, I'm grateful to have ever tried this. This was my number one whale. So my prejudice preceded me. It is very good, but arguably, not any better than some of the other widely available quads. In fact, I'd say some of them are equal or better. But this is still great, and what an experience!"
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.57,"Dark brown quad colour, but clear, no haze. Very nice tight darker than white head. Smell is malty, caramel and spice, with a little something I can't quite name. Taste is the same with a smooth feel even though the beer retains head very well. Very nice, though unsurprisingly not quite worth the hype."
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.71,poured from a 330mL bottle into a st bernardus oversized wine / belgian glass. medium brown with light brown edges and a huge light khaki colored foam head. huge esters / phenols on the nose with some rye and caramel. taste follows. barely any hint of the abv until it finally hit room temp. really smooth and good. lots of rye spice to my tastebuds. thick mouthfeel. slick and making it all the easier drinking. this was great. long-time want for me and it delivered big time.
The Adjunct Trail - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.41,"Having found the original to be good but not great, I was curious to see how the barrel affected the proceedings, at last I know thanks to the power of bottle shares! Oily black pour, no head. Aromas of potent hazelnut, coffee, coconut and most of all dark chocolate meet the bourbon powerfully, slight marshmallow, vanillins, and malt in the background, wow. Taste is still a diabetic nightmare, but the bourbon barrel does help balance more, thus less coconut and marshmallow, more dark oak, hazelnut, coffee, and an addition of caramel compared to the nose. The feel just has so much residual sugar, making a shellac over any barrel depth, malts are smooth. An opulent dessert of a stout, only in america"
The Adjunct Trail - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.42,"Sweet milk chocolate, slightly malty, hazelnut mocha coffee, nutty coconut, and a subtle bourbon barrel nose on this one! Taste follows with those chocolate and hazelnut coffee notes upfront...and then a hint of coconut and hint of bourbon barrel finish. This is showing just a touch of age as the previous pour I had of this was over a year ago and the coconut notes were much more prominent back then. It seems that the mouthfeel is a touch thinner as well. This needed more coconut, more barrel, and more viscosity to hang with the bigbois, but this is still very tasty."
The Adjunct Trail - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.6,"Filling in backlog from Untappd. From Other Half Stout Season fest 2023.

Maman,4.1,"It’s Friday night & after a blah date I’ve decided to date myself, watching a sci-fi moving with my 750ML bestie. Let’s go!

The pour is black, short-lived poodle brown head. The nose is no surprise: bourbon, black malts, oak, booze.

Maman comes wielding booze & bourbon like a broadsword. This might be a short date ending in a long nap. Intense bourbon cut by Kansas soil, pre-Depression. All the malts. Deep. Divisive. Sweet. Jets of molasses, fountains of booze. Licorice bark. Does licorice have bark? Full. Obviously drinkable, since I’m close to finishing this big glass jerk.

Well. A one-night stand, for sure, probably ending at about 5:30 AM when I stumble bumble into the biffy. Lacking complexity but very tasty; an excellent brew."
Maman,4.68,"Pours a deep black color. Aroma is balanced combination of milk chocolate, roasted malts, oakiness and bourbon. Taste turns up the intensity from the aroma. Incredible sweetnesss of the chocolate & bourbon with more oakiness & malts. Full, creamy mouthfeel worthy of the intense flavors. Incredible stout."
Maman,4.14,On tap at The Answer. Thickish mouthfeel. Coca cola and bourbon flavours.A rich liquor smell and mouthfeel.no head. Can sip this all night. Superior (2023 TWCP variant)
Maman,4.67,"Pours a light-swallowing black color and sports a mocha colored head that leaves a nice ring around the beer. Gorgeous BA imperial stout.

The nose is crammed full of roasty malt aromas, a nice bit of milk chocolate, and a big bourbon aroma along with a scintillating oak aroma.

The oak is even more pronounced on the taste and joins the significant bourbon flavor to provide balance to the sweetness of the milk chocolate and roasty malt flavors. This is truly delicious.

The full, creamy mouthfeel complements all components of this beer. What a TREMENDOUS BA imperial stout this is."
Maman,4.55,"At long last! But does this ""mother"" of all perennial stouts stand the test of time? Pitch black with brown cap and slight tint nearby. Smells of bourbon, molasses, dark chocolate, roasted malt, with supporting aromas of vanilla, brown sugar, dark wet wood, and leather, wow. Taste starts with baker’s dark chocolate, molasses, a hint of licorice and leather, then bourbon, vanillins, plum, lighter roasted malt, and charred wood. Feel is smooth and thick but not heavy or sludgy, roast is felt more than tasted, warm before cooling off through the sip, refined with intentional rustic glimpses especially the barrel. To answer my own question, yes it does, it is not just a blank canvas on which masterpieces are made, it is already a work of art on its own"
Maman,4.46,"I've gazed upon this brew in the top 250 list for the past 5 years now. A poignant, five letter word. Maman. Let's get into it.

Looks like the Midnight Mother's own inky essence getting poured into a glass. I don't think you could stir any sort of bubbles out this with a whisk. I do enjoy when I can see how viscous a brew will on that first pour though.

Nose is huge oak, bourbon, and booze right out of the gate. Powerful as hell. Storming out of the glass. The roasted malt and dark fruit are right behind in line trying to get out. This is a turbocharged, naturally aspirated stout.

Now on the taste is where we get more of a story. Oak and bourbon, first. Then the roasted malt, dark fruit like raisins, incredibly dark chocolate, wisps of vanilla, and a slight hint of coconut from the barrel influence. The barrel really just dominates in every aspect of this brew.

Mouthfeel is where it gets divisive. The texture is to die for. Silky, rich and smooth, but the alcohol screams off of your palate like water on a hot skillet. This is a damn hot brew. So if anybody has the 2024 version, either age it for a year of two, or slow slip this with a nice book over a day or two's time.

Overall this is a monster brew that could have used a little time in the cellar. The flavors are potent, but maybe lacking in some nuance due to how the ethanol comes out of the gate swinging. Give this one some time, and I think you'll be better off."
Maman,4.55,"2023 vintage.

Reminds me of a ""Beer:Barrel:Time Light"". Has that same deep syrupy black appearance, the same expressive aromas of nougat, marzipan, brownie batter, vanilla, marshmallow, coconut, and bourbon barrel, the same sweet but not cloying milke chocolate/nougat/espresso/marshmallow flavors, and the same viscous mouthfeel. Just everything is a bit lighter, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Overall fantastic all around, glad to finally be checking off this long time want. I feel like this one has held up to the test of time. Like with BBT, can't believe this has no adjuncts...

Ann,4.95,Fantastic
Ann,4.84,"2015 batch, which I think is batch #3. Bottle pour from Hill Farmstead Brewery in Greensboro, VT.

This one pours a fairly clear golden orange color, with a small head, and a bit of lacing.

This smells like lemon peel, tea, honey, grassy funk, white wine, pear skin, melon, Riesling, and a minerally funk.

This is my biggest white whale, the beer I have most wanted to try since first trying Hill Farmstead originally 10 years ago. It’s tremendous, just about as good as it gets for saison, but, it wasn’t even the best beer I had from Hill Farmstead on my recent trip. That’s how high the bar is for this long-time favorite brewery of mine. This has soft, subtle, and richly complex flavor to it. There’s the obvious honey, almost like honey-soaked pears, or something like that, with white wine, Riesling grapes, melon, apricot jam, and a floral and minerally funk. All of these flavor descriptions make it seem like it’s a super strong and intense beer – it really isn’t. It’s really delicate, and rewards slower sipping and enjoying.

This is light bodied, soft, almost creamy, with a wonderful drinkability. It’s well carbonated, but in a subtle way.

This might not be the exact top of the mountain for Hill Farmstead – that’s probably Samuel, or one of the SARA Residency beers. But this is pretty close to the top, and a perfect expression of an already great beer in Anna."
Doubleganger,4.45,"really special stuff, one of the best bigger ipa types ive had from these guys, and worthy of its insane scores here on BA, its one of the softer feeling strong hazy ones out there, its bold as can be on the hops, carrying much more bitterness than is standard too, but staying well away from over hopped harshness of any kind, vegetal burn, or that supersaturated thing where its permanent on the palate. this is off dry and not super malty, but somehow retains its balance, fluffy feeling and airy, but well structured and supportive too, and the carbonation is excited and the bubbles are tiny, the mouthfeel is an essential feature of this, really impressive specimen! quite cloudy with a real starchy look to it, deeper in color, rust to even light copper, lots of body but also lots of head, as high as you want to make it with the aggressiveness of the can pour, pure white, creamy, and lasting, cool whip textured, only slightly intimidating overall. i get mango and coconut in both the aroma and flavor, with supporting notes to both senses of ripe peach and apricot, floral raw honey, and straw and hay, major harvest time vibes to this, orchard fruit character, a tropical juiciness, really clean compared to how it looks, intentional in every way, killer water chemistry which is a theme with their hazy stuff, thats part of the magic, has to be. the alcohol remains well hidden even as it warms, there is a light woodiness to this too, almost how centennial sometimes hits like milled pine boards, but im not sure what the hops are here, and its well fruity the whole way too. lightly bready on the grain side, wheat likely, oats maybe too, this is rather sturdy. i get an almost concentrated hop intensity, but there is no burn, which suggests to me a hop product, cryo or something, id love to know more about it. so soft in the texture, not as filling as i am making it sound, spritzy the whole time, and just downright delicious, aftertaste of good weed, herbal bitterness, and more coconut. so good, one of my favorites from a big run through a lot of tree house four packs!"
Doubleganger,4.41,"Poured from a can into a pint teku glass
Appearance – The beer pours a very heavy orange-yellow color with a thick and heavy head of off-white foam. The head has a good level of retention, fading slowly over time and leaving tons of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is heavy of a raw and green hop smell with lots of grapefruit and pine hop smell mixed with herbal hop notes and some nice green grass smells. Along with these smells comes a good showing of tropical fruits with notes of pineapple, guava, mango, and tangerine. Other aromas of peach and nectarine and a bit of apricot. Along with these smells comes aromas of pepper and spice, as well as some
Taste – The taste begins with a mix of bready malt paired with the raw hop that was in the nose. The hop is biggest of a raw and very green pine and herbal hop flavor, but is complimented by a little bit of grapefruit and notes of a floral hop. The tropical fruits are not as big as I would have anticipated from the nose, playing an accessory role to the bready malt and some stone fruit flavors of peach and apricot. As the taste advances, some grass and spice join in with the spice being of a white pepper and coriander flavor. At the very end, the raw hop fades a touch, and a little bit of alcohol and wood join in, leaving one with a still very green and raw hopped, slightly malty taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is quite thick and heavy with a carbonation level that is on the moderate to slightly lower side. For the big flavors and raw hopped nature the feel is good and makes for a slow and savorable sipper.
Overall –A rather big and raw hopped up brew, with a big showing of malt and hop. Big and bold."
Doubleganger,4.59,"From a three-week-old can, pours a very hazy dark orange. Smell features ripe mango, citrus, ripe stone fruit and a little resinous dank. Taste follows, with a blast of grapefruit on the finish. Touch of bitterness in the finish. Fantastic."
Doubleganger,4.46,Beautiful orange hazy hue. Not much head. Smell of ripe citrus and mango which followed on the palate. Great to have this on draft at Tree House this week.
Doubleganger,4.41,"Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Double your fun 12/07/2023.

Peach orange with lemon and muted chestnut brown highlights. Not quite turbid, but a solid opaque color with some variations and a bit of mild shine as well. Creamed white three to four finger high tall head, with crowning and clinking thick lace.

Beating hop aroma, pungent with dank sweetness that hits with excellent smokey tones. Sweet wood and touches of faint hinting juiced fruit. Weed like with gummy fruit sensations hiding slightly.

Very enjoyable palate. Mid rush of juiced fruit, and more so of ju jube candies, soft and chewy with a pliable dense mouthfeel. Gummy fruit mixing with earth and dank flavors particularly on the finish. Excellent mild astringency and that slowly builds with nice hop warmth and herbs.

Unexpected palate, was expecting more of an earthy explosion, but the candy gummy fruit flavor on this is a real treat with the dank delicious mix."

Fuzzy,4.55,"I'm finding I am really enjoying white peaches specifically in wild ales, just lend themselves to barrel, funk and botanicals so well. Here SP has done well to allowing the juicy peach tones shine too. Smell is damn impressive: sour peach, yogurt, barnyard, and barrel funks, bright and rustic oak, pressed flowers, dry earth, a touch of lemon and lime zest, and finished with big hay. Taste is more sour and less complex with funk losing the barrel variety to the sour fruits, otherwise the same with sneaky complexity yet potent. Feel is sour and decently acidic, but gentle, dries out with various funks, almost feels more pungent than it tastes or smells. Clear yellow body with a pinky finger of white foam. This is right up there with the best peach wild ales, little less acidity and it could be the very top"
Fuzzy,4.49,"2022 vintage

Here we are, the #1 Wild Ale on BA for my 1500th review! This is a special one that has been a long time want for me, so I’m very excited to finally try it. I’ve only had a few Side Project beers, but they’ve all been fantastic so I have no reason to think this one wouldn’t be. Let’s get into it

Pours a cloudy pale gold with 2 fingers of whitehead that quickly fades to a ring and leaves no lacing

This is certainly tart in the nose, but it has a surprisingly nice balance to it. I'm picking up on aromas of tart peach, lemon yogurt, sharp oak, tannic white wine, straw, bready malt, wildflower honey, apple skin, light vinegar, stone, and even a touch of smoke

In taste it starts off with a balanced tartness similar to the aroma, and on the back end explodes with an aggressive flash of tartness before settling down once again. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting jammy peach, lemon juice, vanilla, wet hay, straw, smooth oak, leather, and white grape. The swallow brings notes of tart peach, lemon juice, crabapple, white wine vinegar, sharp oak, wet hay, vanilla, bready malt, and light peat smoke

A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a puckering beer. Finishes a tad sticky but dries out over time

Oh yeah, this is damn good. Despite the not so good looks, everything else here is awesome. A truly unique beer"
Fuzzy,4.42,"Appearance - The beer was the color of a peach. It was orange with red hues toward the center.

Smell - The beer smelled like sour peaches. There was an undercurrent of sweetness, like vanilla.

Taste - The profile was quite acidic, like a soured peach. Notes of peach and peach skin were detected. There seemed of be the presence of vanilla sweetness as well. The profile had a nice sour peach finish.

Mouthfeel - The body had little carbonation, but a pleasant smoothness.

Overall - This is a sour that I can enjoy, and I am not a sour guy."
Fuzzy,4.57,"This was a guest beer on tap during the 2021 Zwanze Day celebration I attended.
2020 Fuzzy, at a year’s age.

Loved the nose on this. Stone fruit in season, white peach and a hint of funk. It’s tart, without being overly sour, with a nuanced finish. More of the peach notes, leaving the palate tingling. Fantastic."
Fuzzy,4.15,"A: Tangerine pour with fiery hues to apricot. The neck films a shade of macaroon cream that’s dismissive per inscription, from the preset retention. Howbeit, an irksomeness to turns offers lace docility, as the intervals thermally protract. There’s a touch of transparency upon the settlements of course, while effervescence becomes a mobilized variance

S: Pierced rusticity for white peach with esterification authorities. Illustrated by, a bitingly tart eruption that’s tamed enough for the developing – wild yeast – appearances. The progression opts for some grainy malt to the motivated horsed phenols, which quietly idle funk steps. Principally, satchels and farmstalls with soiled mold. Nonetheless, acidity is tenacious on fruit bouquets, as the lactic stability is detrimental to frowzy quirks. There’s elements of solvency thru the open air drafts, which incriminate nail polish and naphtha agents. On the other hand, that piece is often stupefied, given the peppery phenol attunement to floral hops, and biscuit-y malt brackets to stone fruit minerals

T: A clean, consecutive, punch-down stomp that puts natural peaches in vanguard. Notations subtly follow in ripening depictions of Goldrich apricots and Armking nectarines, while briny minerals perimeter Neptune grass. In correlation, an engine for Eugenol to promptly pump in cloves and nutmeg, while maintaining that peppery attenuation. The ongoing drive is earthy and persistently bright, with calming acidity on the advances of rural funk. To that end, the move adds haystacks atop the citrus connotations, but keeps that musty jazz in a distant place. Aerial attacks begin setting in, from oak dragged elasticities, and prompt in some leathery satchels. Whilst, Chardonnay attenuates a staleness for Budapestlängd with an oxidative nuttiness

M: Does not puncture with puckered acridity, but rather maintains a level of energy that rationally aids. Namely, a backend for rustic brettanomyces, and a pillar for biscuit-y grains. The approach is brisk in carbonation, as the approach is crisp in sensation. Thus, cleanly bright with minor overextensions in the presetting bites, but pleasingly uplifting in the dry – erosional – reliefs

O: Showcases clean peach natures with a caustic effervescence that’s costly to the preliminary entwines, of wild yeast. Though, development is rapid enough to calm the impaling authorities, and make rational moves. In this situation, light malts provide an aid to earthy hop kicks, while acclimating spiced esters with musty phenols. The approach is thereby tart with brett funk complexions, and spurs wooded fruit tannins on an astutely dry/crisp exhibition"

Smell - nice slight peach wild ale smell

Nectarine Premiere,4.17,"Bottled 10/22 consumed 06/21/24. The cost for 750 mL was ~$20.

A&S: Fizzy-looking tangerine-colored beer when initially poured. Its white head disappears immediately. The beer is so fizzy you can hear it. The beer undergoes a huge transformation in color when the sediment is poured in, it goes from bright tangerine to ruby orange-red. The aroma is moderately strong and pleasant, but pretty one-dimensional, stone fruits and citrus (nectarines and tangerines). As a side, the cork doesn't have much of an aroma.

T&M Puckeringly tart off the bat. The same fruits as the aroma come out more in the second pour. It's super drinkable once it warms a bit and more of the sediment is poured in, but lacks a lot of funk I am accustomed to for this style. Some acidity
but no real Brett character, no barn-yard, or oak. I did enjoy that it wasn't overly sweet. The mouthfeel is very fizzy, and spritz-like. Alcohol is very well hidden for being 8%, however, I also never felt like I got an 8% ABV buzz. Good effervesce. It was likely bottle-conditioned since it had more carbonation than I would expect after being aged in barrels for a year and in the bottle for 2 more years.

Overall: Initially this beer was just above average, it opened up a little, and my rankings changed a bit, but overall I have to say I was disappointed. I thought the quality to price point was about right, but to be currently ranked #7 for Saisons, I just felt like it never came close to reaching that for me. It lacked the funk."
Nectarine Premiere,4.39,"Poured from a 750ml bottle dated 10-22 into a teku glass.

Look- Pale gold, very hazy, white sudsy head that dissipates quickly, below average head retention and lacing.

Smell- Nectarine, oak, funk, medium strength of scent.

Taste- Nectarine, oak, lemongrass, funk, moderately sweet, highly sour, moderately acidic, high strength of flavor.

Feel- Medium body, slightly above average carbonation, highly dry finish, highly sour, moderately sweet, moderately acidic, flavor lingers on palate.

Overall- Very complex and interesting drinking experience."
Nectarine Premiere,4.41,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into an oversized wine glass

Look: A hazy orange with a very thin white head that dissipates quickly.

Smell: Sweet and fresh nectarine hits the nose immediately. This fades into a buttery oak with some hay like funk. A little salty and mildly acidic.

Taste: Nectarine juice shocks the palate that fades to a buttery oak. This is punched aside by a lightly briny sour note that fades to more nectarine stone fruit notes on the finish.

Feel: Bright, clean, mildly acidic. No alcohol noted. Light carbonation.

Overall: A beautiful and clean sour. The brewery really knows what they are doing!"
Nectarine Premiere,4.39,"6/2019 Batch! Sweet and tart, fruity-yeasty funky, a hint of oak-barrel, and a nice and sweet, nectarine stonefruity nose on this one! Nice aromatics!

The oak barrel is pretty well integrated at this point...I was just hoping for a little more jammy-sweet nectarine on the palate. Delicious!"

Alright folks, here we are, the final BIF beer I received from @Eziel! It’s been a wild 6 months of hard to find beers, and we’re ending with the heaviest hitter of the bunch. This is currently the 5th highest rated Saison on BA and 52nd overall. Those are some impressive stats. Also, I’m not sure if I’ve ever seen a beer fruited with only nectarine, it’s usually a blend. Let’s get into it

Pours an opaque orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that very quickly fizzes away to nothing and leaves no lacing

Sheesh, less than stellar appearance aside, this is bold in the nose, just super fruity and tart with a big funk too. I'm picking up on aromas of sweet nectarine, wet hay, tart apricot, sharp oak, lemon yogurt, wildflower honey, straw, and crackery malt

Oh man, the funk is even punchier in taste, but not in a way that's out of balance. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting tart peach, lemon juice, white wine vinegar, stone, sharp oak, nectarine, wet hay, honey, and lemongrass. The swallow brings notes of wet hay, stone, white wine vinegar, peach pit, nectarine, sharp oak, crackery malt, lemon yogurt, and light orange juice

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp and zippy beer. Finishes bone dry with a lovely balance of sour fruit and funk

Wow, this is one hell of a beer! It's highly complex, yet I could chug it. But why would I do that? I plan on nursing this bottle over the course of the night"
Aaron,4.86,"The perfect barleywine ale. Enjoyed this pour at Hill Farmstead in March 2024. The vintage was 2019, then aged two years in bourbon barrels. Copper colored liquid with the most minimal trace of bubbles around the glass. The nose brings out caramel, bourbon and oak, but the flavor...! Deep, deep flavor. Dark fruits--raisins, figs, dates with a mild woody backbone--I dare you not to close your eyes while sipping. Absolutely brilliant barleywine experience."

KBS,4.66,"Hard to believe I’ve missed rating this classic for so long. Here goes…. From a 12 oz bottle dated within 5 months of consumption, into a Perfect Pint glass. Engine oil brown color with thick brown tan head with slow fade leaving some clumpy lacing and a thin cap. Nose of sweet malts, dark chocolate, a little coffee, dark fruit (raspberry?) and peppery spice. Tastes malt-coffee chocolate forward with some dry bitter hops at the end wrapping things up. Balanced toward the dry bitter hoppy end of the spectrum. Mouth is not as thick as I would have expected, but still moderately viscous. Alcohol is well masked; this one can sneak up on you. Overall – I’m not sure I’d rate this as “World Class.” I looked back at my Breakfast Stout notes and see that I had a similar reception to that one. Still very good, definitely recommended."
KBS,4.93,"Colossal victory of a beer. A bulldozing pioneer of quality and creativity. A pillar of its class, and a massive source of pride/credibility for Founders. This beer will end your night and you might literally find yourself skipping drinking tomorrow. (?????) it’s just that heavy of a beer. Don’t hesitate to split a 12oz four ways! Richhhhh. 12.5abv

Fruit and whisky and chalky sooty flinty vibe, almost metallic, but pleasant, caramel, toffee scents effuse from the glass. Very cold (39f) hard pour gave .5cm thick mocha head (not bad for 12.5%abv) settling into bubble islands and a cinnamon rim.

The beer is succulent, roasty, supple. Huge carbonation for the style and size. Massive in so many dimensions- but quaffable at a very cold temp. Gets more flavorful, sweeter and thicker as it warms somehow tho lol. Leathery, faint char, bakers chocolately, insane choco malt richness, whispers of vanilla and spice, huge coffee / espresso, tons of barrel… all somehow in balance. Layers. A masterpiece. YUM!"
KBS,2.38,"Overrated. many irish dry stouts are better. Strong but not flavourful.

Very disappointed in this beer. Was expecting a lot. Not very drinkable, i struggled my way through it."
KBS,4.61,"I do like this beer a great deal. I haven't had it in awhile, but in 2018 I remember thoroughly enjoying this brew. It had all the right aging, balance, dark coffee/chocolate flavored malt, and hidden alcohol. So, it is definitely at my top 5 stouts I've had of all time."
KBS,4.85,"This is the standard imo of my favorite beer style. It checks all the boxes of a great Imperial Stout. Thick and dark with a tan head. Aroma so satisfying that it takes effort to pull your nose away from the glass. But you do bc you know of the party that awaits your tastebuds. This is one of the most delicious beers I’ve ever had period, any style. A dessert in a bottle. I would drink these every day with every meal. But I don’t, bc my liver would hate me."
KBS,4.43,Excellent flavorful deserving of high rating.
KBS,3.09,"The booziest stout I've ever had, and I've had plenty with higher ABV. Nice complexity. Brownie and vanilla notes. Very solid but not especially impressive. Breakfast Stout is better and much cheaper. Must have been amazing when it first came out, but today it falls behind."
Bourbon County Brand Stout,3.91,"This version came with a flat 14% ABV on the label. It came in a lovely 16.9 ounce brown bottle. The entire contents of which now temporarily reside inside a clear glass liter mug. The tan head, resulting from the pour, did not last. Of course, it's black coffee brown. There's plenty to smell, as the nose gets hit with alcohol, tannins and roasted malt, pretty close to that order. The taste is more complex. There's a bit of the coffee and dark chocolate references that come from this style. But, the alcohol and tannins still dominate and that's disappointing for someone that doesn't appreciate a stout tasting like a shot of bourbon, even in this case, good bourbon. This doesn't taste badly, just below expectations. This was bottled in 2021, so it has had a decent chance to age. Yet, it tastes like it hasn't. There's no anticipated melding of the flavors to create good nuances. Disappointing doesn't mean bad, at least in this case. Nor does it mean exceptional, as this one is not. Lastly, there's no glass lacing, but the body is good."
Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.02,"Note: I am in the process of moving all of my ratings from other beer sites to here, so that all of my ratings are consolidated in one place. The review below is an exact copy of my original RateBeer review from 10/16/2020.


1 pint .9 fl. Oz. Bottle.

I have tried the last 3 years of vintage (2017, 2018, and 2019) and have rated each vintage separately as I tried them. Although, with the exception of a few tasting notes and the alcohol content, I can't say that there has been much difference between the vintages. This is (and apparently always will be) a big, boozy, beer that is extremely sweet. I enjoy it immensely, but I do find that the syrupy sweetness becomes a little overpowering by the time I am finishing the beer. Basically, it is liquid candy for adults!!

2019 Vintage (18AUG24) - 14.7% abv
AROMA (9/10): Big, boozy notes of soy sauce, vanilla, and alcohol with some slight smoke undertones.

APPEARANCE (4/5): Pours an opaque black with a weak, dark tan, head that dissipates quickly. Granted, I am drinking this almost 2 years after the bottled date, but given that the label says that it develops in the bottle up to 5 years, I would expect more body and life from the head. Lacing is almost non-existent too.

TASTE (7/10): Very sweet with huge flavors of dark fruit (e.g. raisins) and caramel, with just a hint of vanilla and smoke on the back end.

MOUTHFEEL (4/5): Thick bodied with a creamy smooth texture. Carbonation is average and the finish is medium and sweet.

OVERALL (18/20): I really like this beer but it is almost too sweet for my tastes. Even though the alcohol content is less, I am really not detecting any difference between this and the 2018 vintage. I would prefer it if this one were less sweet and had more smokiness. Or at least something to offset all that sweetness.


2018 Vintage (17SEP18) - 15.2% abv
AROMA (9/10): Big notes of soy sauce, vanilla, and alcohol with some slight smoke undertones.

APPEARANCE (4/5): Pours an opaque black with a weak, dark tan, head that dissipates quickly.

TASTE (7/10): Very sweet with flavors of dark fruit (e.g. raisins) and caramel, with just a hint of smoke on the back end.

MOUTHFEEL (4/5): Thick bodied with a creamy smooth texture. Carbonation is average and the finish is medium and sweet.

OVERALL (18/20): I really like this beer but it is almost too sweet for my tastes. Compared to the 2017 vintage, this one seems to have even less smoky flavor, and the 2017 didn't have much to begin with. I would prefer it if this one were less sweet and had more smokiness.


2017 Vintage (04AUG17).
AROMA (9/10): Big notes of soy sauce, caramelized brown sugar, alcohol, and dark fruits (e.g. raisins).

APPEARANCE (4/5): Pours an opaque black with a weak, dark tan, head that dissipates quickly.

TASTE (7/10): Very sweet with flavors of dark fruit and caramel, with just a hint of smoke on the back end.

PALATE (4/5): Thick bodied with a creamy smooth texture. Carbonation is average and the finish is short and sweet.

OVERALL (18/20): I really like this beer but it is almost too sweet for my tastes. I would prefer it if it were a little less sweet and had just a pinch more smokiness. But all in all, a fantastic beer. I can’t wait to try the 2018 vintage to see how it compares!"
Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.5,"2023 bottle with exp date of 07 AUGUST 2028, enjoyed 6/1/2024.
Getting past the soy sauce and trying to imagine some sort of bourbonized liquid chocolate, this was actually enjoyable.
It's smooth, thick and rich. It's like drinking liquid chocolate with whiskey in it, ok maybe not so much, but definitely has wine like qualities.
At 14.1 percent ABV, this really packs a punch! But it's pretty mellow, not hot whatsoever.
Flavor really sticks around. I can see this going well with smoked brisket that has a good bark.
A very good sipper, excellent flavor profile between sips."
Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.63,"Finally crossing this historically great brew off my list. 2022 Vintage and 14.3% ABV. Drink by 29Jun27. Served cool into a brandy snifter.

Appearance - Very dark brown from the bottle and virtually black in the glass. Thick and oily looking and a small half finger of deep tan head is poured and fizzles away into nothingness within a minute. Tiny little foamy collar left behind.

Smell - A huge plethora of aromas come to the nose immediately. Leather, molasses, bourbon, treacle, burnt brown sugar, with some fudge-y chocolate backing that up. Dark fruits like prunes and figs are also there. Vanilla is present throughout but subdued. The big thing is the sheer number of aromas and how well they play together.

Taste - Bitter and boozy upfront with vanilla accenting everything before there is some molasses that trhen transitions to sweet slightly toasted brown sugar. Back to bitterness with roasted malts, some dark chocolate and molasses mixture before finishing with a soft toffee. Leather gets mixed in with the earthiness too. The booze is present but well disguised for a 29 proof beer. It drinks and the intensity of the booze is pretty akin to most other 11-12.5% imperial stouts, so there is a smoothness. Taste kind of fades away eventually but after a couple of sips the booziness lingers reminding you of the strength. The depth and variety of flavor here is impressive.

Mouthfeel - Thick and chewy, little prickles of carbonation try to shine through but really full bodied. Gentle warming heat in the back of the throat.

Overall - Probably the best stout I've ever had the chance to enjoy, this lives up to the billing and the hype and I'm so stoked that I have a 2023 vintage to enjoy as well. Very much worth the price for a one off special occasion brew."
Bourbon County Brand Stout,5.0,"Almost wine, absolutely perfect."
Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.0,"2022 Version (bottled 10/2022 1.5 years old)

Appearance: Pours a completely dark black color with a moderate black head that fades. (4.00)

Aroma: Strong aromas of bourbon mixed with some chocolate and dark malts. (4.00)

Flavor: Strong and rich flavors of bourbon upfront. A little hot. Then it fades into chocolate and some complex dark malt flaovrs including bread, strudel, maple syrup, caramel, and toffee. Smooth but sweet and more bourbon off the end. (4.00)

Feel: Heavier-bodied, average to lower carbonation. Rich, sweet, shows the bourbon and a bit hot. (4.00)

Overall: Heavy on the bourbon as expected. Evolves into complex malt flavors of chocolate, caramel, toffee, and maple syrup. Less carbonation than I expect and it drinks heavy, sweet, and a bit hot showing the booze a bit. I'm sort of getting the hang of and appreciating BBA stouts, but these 14%+ ones are on a different level that my palate has still not quite primed for. I'm sure it's a World-Class beer, but all I'm getting is a lot of bourbon, booze, and sweetness. It's good, big and a sipper. (Rating: 4.00)"
Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.75,"By far the best stout that has ever crossed my lips. Beats KBS, beats CBS, beats Narwhal, beats Ten Fidy....Just try it."
Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.57,Aged 1 additional year. Dark color with a darker head the vanished quickly. Strong sweet bourbon aroma and flavor with hints of caramel and chocolate.
Parabola,4.75,"Magnificent. Mistimed keys clicking away in a coffee shop. The live band plays their best, despite the audience not clapping. The vibes are what you want to get your creativity going.

Rich coffee, caramel, brown sugar, and maple syrup. This is a barrel aged stout to beat! Unfortunately it lacks complexity to keep it from being a perfect 5/5, but the density gives it a wonderful albeit short finish."
Parabola,4.56,2024 Vintage
Parabola,4.68,"The 2024 edition of Firestone Walker's Parabola is a great integration of flavors from its aging process in Elijah Craig 12-year-old barrels. Pours a deep ebony, with a dark brown head that swiftly transitions to subtle lace. Aroma is a blend of vanilla, molasses, and bourbon undertones.

Taste is dark chocolate and roasted malts, balanced by a bourbon warmth. Notes of dark fruits and coffee with a boozy finish that lingers with hints of oak and molasses. Mouthfeel is smooth with moderate carbonation and syrupy mouthfeel.

Nice complexity and smooth drinkability, that will only get better with age."
Parabola,4.92,"2023 edition.

Firestone Walker knocked it out of the park with this one! Blanton's barrels? Weller barrels? You cannot possibly go wrong with two of the heavy hitters from Buffalo Trace. If F.W.B. had put ""collaboration with Buffalo Trace"" on the front of the box, these bottles would have been impossible to find. They would have immediately gone into collections. As it is, I'm very happy I was able to get my hands on a few of these, and they will be shared with my friends who are huge Buffalo Trace fans. This beer lives up to the hype you expect when the name Buffalo Trace is dropped. Smooth. Boozy. Packed with layers of flavor, just like the bourbons it's shared a home with. Store a few of these away with the wine. This is a collectors item."
Parabola,4.2,"2018 vintage.

While I've had Parabola before, this is my first time rating it, and as such I found myself paying more attention to it than normal. The first thing that struck me was that as this poured out of the bottle, it had a surprising amber hue with almost Dr. Pepper vibes. In the glass it's the super deep brown I expected, but with just a little bit of light coming in around the edges. Not much in the way of head, but given the ABV and age this came as no surprise.

The aroma doesn't burst from the glass, but up close it is wonderful. Vanilla, milk chocolate and faint oak are all present, and combine to create a very nice smelling beer.

Taste is much less sweet than the nose. I'm greeted with strong roasted malts lending a nice bitterness that is well balanced by chocolate notes and faint fig notes mid-palate. Barrel and alcohol show up more on the finish.

Overall, an excellent, no-frills beer."
Parabola,4.25,"2019 Vintage

A - Pours opaque, almost black with brown highlights, with a light tan head that fades to a rim with minimal lacing.

S - Pungent bourbon note, wood and vanilla, with chocolate and molasses beneath.

T - Strong alcohol hit, vanilla and dark fruits, bourbon barrel through the middle, a bit of molasses, alcohol and acidity tailing away in the finish.

M - Sharp on the tongue, strong carbonation and moderate weight, closing clean enough to invite another drink.

O - Nothing wrong with this brew. The main difficulty I have is this is very much the same barrel aged experience that I get from a dozen other brews. This is well built, but not exceptional."
Parabola,4.45,"Pours an effervescent ebony with a pinky+ of caramel colored head ( tight ), Average-ish head retention & lacing

S: Dark fruit, molasses, caramel & maple syrup once warm. Some nice Bourbon notes once warm, vanilla as well

T: Follows the nose, raw barrel, a touch of caramel & maple syrup, some coffee notes up front. Barrel dryness/rawness, a touch of coconut & maple candy, then some stronger coffee, plus the Bourbon claws through, along with some chocolate once this beer is near room temperature. Finishes with oaky booze bite, some caramel, maple syrup, figs, molasses, & leafy hops

MF: Chewy, restrained carbonation, much warmth. Just gets chewier as this beer warms up

Great BA Imp Stout! Not even a close to a chore to drink; dangerous!"
Parabola,4.42,A great true to style RIS. I try to have this every year when it's released.
Parabola,4.74,"Poured from a bottle. 2023 vintage.


Appearance - Body is black as the night with a dark brown short head that disappears into some wispy bubbles. The dark brown head was expected and didn’t disappoint.

Smell - Malty and molasses, chocolatey and some boozy bourbon hints. Not overpowering but pleasant.

Taste -Malty right away. Some coffee tones and darker fruits. Smooth chocolate finish with some mild hints of booze. Great taste and pleasantly surprised by the subdued alcohol boozy presence throughout the sampling. Very rich beer.

Feel -Lower carbonation, minimal boozy sting and a lighter body than expected.

Overall - Great beer that I feel privileged to try. I couldn’t drink many of these in one sitting as they are pretty rich but a very enjoyable beer everyone should sample."
Very HHHazyyy,4.58,Taste like a classic tree house IPA. Waited a couple weeks before opening it and was nice and hoppy. Very smooth no burn at all. Prefer it over haze.
Very HHHazyyy,4.49,"Pours milky yellow-orange like most Treehouse DIPAs. Smell is very similar to my memory of Haze - peaches and hops. Taste echoes the peach notes, but adds a good amount of bitterness. Unlike Orange Thing, which I tried yesterday, the bitterness here seems disconnected from the fruit flavors, whereas in Orange Thing it felt like a part of the whole ""orange"" experience. But overall a very well executed ""upgrade"" to the Haze family."

Tree House Brewing Compa... IPA-Imperial / Double New...

Massive mega citrus and Mango hop aroma is nuts. Thick and deep chunks of fruity hopiness. Smooth and luxurious mouthfeel. Fresh, juicy, smooth and snappy at the same time. Soft earthy spice and incredible golden grainy balance is perfect for this style.

Double Citra®,4.6,"On tap at Sabatinis in Exeter pa late this afternoon.

Slightly hazy yellow body with a persistent white head. Broken rings of lacing. Aroma is delightfully fresh citrus. On tasting, citra hops of course. Clean, sweet and bitter.

I never cease to be amazed by the quality of the finish of HF beers. A slow progression of sweet to citra hoppy to bitter to warming. Delightful

Overall, another fantastic HF beer. Some day, I hope to visit the brewery to thank them for all this enjoyment"
Double Citra®,4.77,"Just another amazing double IPA from Hill Farmstead. Such amazing soft mouth feel that sets up the banquet of Citra hops. Just a great experience. Love the flocky hazy particulate to this particular beer, I hop to get this again soon."
Double Citra®,4.58,"Pours light orange, minimal foam, tons of lacing. Smells like orange rind, very pungent hops. Flavor is out of this world, the very best of Citra. Juicy clementine and orange peel, white gummy bears, slightly dank, with a bitter finish. Not too sweet at all and extremely smooth bitterness. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and goes down incredibly fast.

This is my first Hill Farmstead beer and I understand both the price and hype. I'm disappointed I drank it so fast and didn't get a second pour."
Double Citra®,4.49,"Look - slight haze yellow nice sticky and rimming
Smell - grainy citrus
Taste - grainy citrus resin
Feel - medium body with a medium light carb
Overall - fantastic"
Double Citra®,4.9,"On draft - Pours cloudy hazy yellow orange gold with a creamy white foam head. Notes of fresh peach, ripe mango, pineapple, orange citrus, grapefruit zest, lemon, lime, papaya, apricot jam, passionfruit, guava, melon, berries, a hint of caramelized bready malt, with slightly dank bitter green earthy herbal grassy pine. Feels medium-full bodied, creamy and smooth with moderate low carbonation. Overall a really great Citra hopped DIPA."
Double Citra®,4.8,Draught. Fantastic.
Double Citra®,3.08,"Can't say i was a fan of this one, too much punch without comfortable hop flavor, given the high rank, most think otherwise, but Hill Farmstead has many other more enjoyable for me than this blend."
Flora Plum,4.52,Solid beer - a bit plum tart aftertaste.
Flora Plum,4.76,"Original bottling

It is a clear, reddish plum pour with half a finger of pure white head. It looks less thick than many of the HF saisons I have tried, but ""prettier"".

Tart plum bursts from the bottle and fills the room. As I pour it gets even stronger. My salivary glands fire before I even put nose to glass. Such a delicious aroma, it calls, entices, with fresh plum, tart sourdough, raspberry jam, grape must notes, honeysuckle, hints of spicy alcohol and fresh flowers, in perfect balance to create a stunning aroma.

All the flavors of the nose are here, no need to repeat them, balanced perfectly, in a wonderful blend. It ends a lightly jammy whih fades into a tart, fruity linger. As it warms hints of an herbal bitterness enter the mix, quite lightly, and it gets even better.

Medium body for style, light carbonation which works well here, clean as a whistle, with a brilliantly flavored linger that is just right to bring on desire for next sip.

Another masterpiece from the master I regret not tasting fresh. It has either remained or become a beauty of a beer that is an artistic work of intoxicating refreshment"
Flora Plum,4.74,"After Flora Pear, this is my favorite Flora. Excellent barrel character has been imparted into the beer. Pours a beautiful deep gold, big wine nose, effervescent with plums dancing in the background. Fantastic."
Headroom,4.27,"Look - love the bright orangish yellow milky look with great rimming and lacing
Smell and taste - pretty green with a tropicalness
Feel - medium body with a slight carb
Overall - a little to green but still great"
Headroom,4.79,"Pours opaque yellow gold with a off white 2 finger silky head. Aroma is amazing with pungent, sweet orange and papaya notes. The taste is just as great, a little more on the tart than sweet side, but a nice balance between the two. Orange pith, rich papaya, tart grapefruit all up front with a lingering bitterness that processes more sophistication than a typical.juice bomb. Mouthfeel is very soft and cushiony, with a moderate tartness that grows into the finish. I can see why this is rated so high, and I agree.

Side note - this reminds me a little of Bissell's old Reciprocal recipe. Was my all around favorite until they changed the recipe. Makes me happy :)"
Headroom,4.9,"#188, yum!"
Headroom,4.54,"Canned 8/29/23 and shipped to PA

Definitely think it borders on living up to the hype - a very good hazy. Super soft and creamy; little grassier than I prefer my IPAs, but this is balanced enough that it's not a detraction nor is it over the top. Glad I finally got the tick on this one, but there are definitely other Trillium hazies I would prefer to this."
Headroom,4.25,Overrated. Highly disappointed. Huge letdown.
Headroom,4.35,Grapefruit sunny D. On draft at Churchkey.
Headroom,4.6,"Pours a very hazy fleshy peach color with a fluffy off white head that leaves ringlets of lace as you enjoy the beer. Gorgeous hazy.

The nose is dank and packed with sweet peach aromas, orange peel, some grapefruit, and lots of mango and pineapple. This is literally a beer fruit basket of aromas.

The peach flavors lead the taste and are delicious, with the orange, mango, and pineapple flavors following, with a bit of green grapes mid palate and a nice creamy oat flavor on the finish. Very balanced and oh so delicious.

The mouthfeel is full, soft, and creamy, adding to the drinkability. This is a magnificent representation of the style, IMHO."
Coconut Vibes,4.46,"Black with no light penetration. There's a fingernail of brown around the rim and a third of the top. The aroma is of chocolate and coconut, like a Mounds bar. I'm tasting coconut, dark chocolate, and black licorice. The mouth is very thick and viscous. The alcohol is well hidden."
Coconut Vibes,4.9,"#187, yum!"
Coconut Vibes,4.77,"Blend 3 - on draft at SP 10th anniversary. This is like a dark choco mounds. Thick and chewy, but the sweetness is reeled in and perfectly balanced. One of the best Non-BA stouts I’ve been lucky enough to try. Excellent beer."
Coconut Vibes,4.43,"While I wanted more coconut up front, this was an amazingly complex beer everywhere else; phenomenal mouthfeel, incredible flavors."
Atrial Rubicite,4.48,"Poured deep red and was capped by a light beige head that dissipated very quickly. Some sediment which is typically present in the style.
The taste is sour raspberry; almost exclusively. I’m sure there is some oak and funk in there somewhere (it *is* a barrel aged sour) but raspberry dominates. Maybe a little honey at the swallow?
The feel is accented by the active carbonation- a sharpness that goes very well with the flavor.
OA, wow, fruit sours can be really good."
Atrial Rubicite,4.79,"Serving: 1 pt. 0.9 fl. oz. bomber poured into a tulip glass. This is Blend Thirteen from July 2023, making this roughly 9 months old.

A: Pours a very dark, ruby red with about a half-finger of fuchsia head that lingers around the rim.

S: Hug raspberry up front. Like a very jammy kind, with tons of seeds. Like you just mashed them together to make raspberry pie and then drizzled some vanilla extract on it. Also getting a little wild berry or boysenberry kind of thing. Very nice.

T: Really nice fresh raspberries up front, followed quickly by a surprising bready/oak note. Quite tart and dry, it's almost like you ground up all the raspberry seeds and then sprinkled them among fresh, mashed raspberries.

M: Very, very tart and sour right away. But after a couple sips to get acclimated, it settles in nice. It's really fruit-driven compared to other sours, and so you lose some of the funk and sour character.

O: So this might be one of my most sought after beers of all time. Not sure why, but it is. I think it goes back to like early 2010s BA with the Top 250 list and this was always near the top. It was one of the first sours to gain a ton of notoriety. Once Jester King hit the Chicago market ca. 2015, I remember checking the shelves every time I went to Binny's to see if they got this in. All the bottles looked similar, but I could never spot the elusive Atrial Rubicite. Then lo and behold, Michigan sees a small drop late last year and I couldn't snatch it up quick enough! I'm sure this beer has been tweaked a bit over the years, but it still holds a Top 75 rating. I'll say, I'm not disappointed even though I'm late to the party. The raspberries are huge on this thing, but it's also got some complex vanilla, oak and woody notes to it once it sits for a bit. Just a wonderful beer that I'm super grateful to finally have after all these years.

Recommendation: One of the true OG sours, it's never to late to try this masterpiece."
Atrial Rubicite,5.0,02/17/24 bottle @ home
Atrial Rubicite,3.92,"2023 vintage.

Raspberry sours tend to really perform well in terms of appearance and aroma and this is no exception. Beautiful ruby red in the glass with total clarity, although not much head at all to speak of. Looks like a fine red wine. Aromas are fresh crushed raspberry jam, fruit leather, cherry pie, pink lemonade, airheads candy, fruit chews, and a hint of wheat. Flavors lean very tart -- lemon juice, unripe raspberry, apple cider vinegar, salinity, drying oak astringency, and almost no sweetness at all. Feel is slippery and puckering. Tasty but a bit sour for me

T -- While the pineapple and orange sherbert notes of Galaxy are definitely there, there's also a decent amount of this interesting nelson-like white grape character, and also a hint of mosaic-lile cattiness. Oat forward malt bill makes for a neutral sweetness

Explosion of tropical flavors, bright, vibrant, with a great mouthfeel. A top notch hazy."

Pours a lily yellow colour, proper dense. Tight head fizzles quickly. Smell is strong tropical fruit, grapefruit. Taste is the same, more on the grapefruit end. Sweetness well balanced by the bitterness. Super smooth and creamy feel, just a tad of on the bitterness to leave you wanting more. Excellent stuff.
Even leaves some lacing impressive."

Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,4.31,"Poured from 16oz can into a dimpled mug. “Manifested” 4/24/24 — a palindrome!

Appearance: super hazy, murky, medium yellow hue with a thick finger of frohty ivory foam atop. Lookit ‘em clouds!

Smell: sweet malt with a nicely rich tropical-fruit character; passionfruit is mostly what I’m getting, maybe a little apricot too. It’s rich, complex, and alluring.

Taste: there’s definitely sweetness here, but it is reasonably balanced with the hop flavors. Again I get tropical passionfruit, maybe a little dankness, and just a hint of sharp citrus that frankly I could do without. Not quite as enjoyable as the aroma for me, but this is still an excellent beer.

Mouthfeel: medium-rich body with a good carbonation and a rich, smooth creaminess. I love it when an IPA can nail creaminess!

Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,4.55,"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased on Tavour
Manifested 11/15/23
Served in a tulip

Pretty extreme appearance. The beer poured an insanely cloudy, almost milky looking, straw yellow hue. A thin, frothy film topped the liquid, but it quickly dissolved. There was no lacing whatsoever.

The aroma was fantastic. It was super dank and fruity. Tropical fruit notes came through strongest. Loads of tangy passionfruit and sweet mango. Ripe peach was also apparent. Bit of juicy citrus too. The dankness subsided pretty quickly but reappeared later.

The flavor profile was also impressive, though more bitter and somewhat simpler than the nose. Citrus notes dominated. Nice mix of juicy orange flesh and bitter orange peel. Tangy tangerine notes were also apparent. Touch of lemony tartness in the center. Hint of passionfruit too. More citrus peel and rind-like bitterness on the back end and the finish.

The mouthfeel was amazingly fluffy and soft. Medium-light bodied for the style. The beer contained a super fine and zippy effervescence that gave this beer and terrific suppleness on the palate.

Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped Is an impressive beer and similar in many regards to some of the better offerings by Tree House, Trillium, etc. From what I can recall, this DDH version is better than the original, but I would need to do a side by side comparison to confirm this."

Pours like thick cloudy orange juice, minimal head and lacing. Smell is strong on the pour, still lasts as it’s drank: citrusy-orange, grapefruit. Slightly dank and a hint of pint. Big juicy citrusy taste, mildly tangy. Medium bodied, crisp, super easy to drink. Just as good as the original - one of the best NEIPA’s I’ve ever had."
Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,4.35,"Poured from a 16 ounce can dated 11-15-23 into a teku glass.

Look- Straw, very hazy, opaque, sudsy white head, below average head retention and lacing.

Smell- Clementine, grapefruit, pineapple, medium strength of scent.

Taste- Clementine, pithy, grapefruit, pineapple, pine, between medium and high strength of flavor.

Feel- Full body, slightly below average carbonation, mildly astringent, moderately bitter, moderately creamy, mildly prickly.

Overall- Nice drinking experience, but the pithiness was a slight detractor."
King Sue,4.84,"4 pack of tallboys from Spec's main store in Austin.

Appearance: Opaque straw blonde glass holds a half finger of white rocky foam that lasts forever leaving laced tide marks.

Aroma: Hop juice. Some tropical mango, a little crystal malt, tangerine nectar.

Taste: For all the hops, really pretty balanced. Loads of fruity flavors, grapefruit rind, hints of bubblegum, esters, with a very faint grainy, almost wheat cracker base.

Mouthfeel: Gritty texture, low carbonation, late chew as it leaves an oily coating behind despite drinking like water.

Overall: Big o'flavors deserve big o'scores. Dangerously drinkable, bold flavors but easy drinking, on the edge of orange juice, very refreshing. Taking a half point on personal preference, this is a top tier IPA, but I would reach for some darker things before this. Strongly recommended."
King Sue,4.55,Yep this is a good one. Very juicy and good amount of abv. Wish it had a little more hoppy kick to it to give it the IPA name but still delicious
King Sue,4.88,"A very full bodied hazy DIPA with citra hops. Hints of mango, orange, pineapple and finished with hints of another fruit. Possibly, grapefruit with a nice bite. Overall, a great DIPA! Smooth and easily followed with medium hit."
King Sue,4.45,"Enjoyed this DIPA - citrusy and refreshing, full body and mouthfeel, goes down easy, enjoyed it with a pizza but just a good by itself on a sunny afternoon"
King Sue,4.56,"16 oz can into a tulip glass.

Look: Hazy, peach juice looking. Nice head with a lot of lacing on glass.

Smell: Fresh orange peel. Candied orange. Some slight piney grapefruit. So citrus forward.

Taste: Very orange forward--both your typical Florida orange juice but also mandarin notes. Hoppy and bright tasting. Slightest black peppercorn/alcoholic bite on the finish.

Feel: The orange notes make it very refreshing and quaffable despite the higher ABV.

Overall: Awesome offering from Toppling Goliath. Daresay worth the $20 a 4 pack price point--I think it's that good of an IPA."
King Sue,4.77,"Big head that lasts. Looks like a glass of 5 Alive.
Flavor and aroma are on point and juicy. Mild, building, bitterness. Nice carbonation; medium body.
Would definitely buy again."
King Sue,4.59,"Hazy peachy color with a thick head that leaves good laces.
Delicious aroma with notes of pineapple, fresh squeezed oranges, mango, lychees and resin.
Flavor with fresh notes of dank and piney resin, natural orange juice, passion fruit, mango, oats, lychees, cantaloupe and grapefruit drops. Dry and bitter aftertaste. 100+ IBUs that could never be so smooth. Not an atom of harshness.
Velvety body with perfect carbonation.
World class juicy Double IPA that borders perfection. Balanced in every way, from bitterness to a flavor mix of tropical, resin and citrus. Incredible how much they were able to extract out of Citra hops alone."
King Sue,5.0,Great grapefruity smell. The fruits do not overwhelm the flavor
Society & Solitude #4,4.21,"citra and galaxy in this true east coast beauty, the only hill beer i managed to score while back east this time, but i found it on tap and liked it a lot. perhaps somewhat less exotic and with a bit lower of an overall wow factor than i was anticipating, but the quality cannot be denied, and neither can the fact that these two hops are awfully compatible, this is juicy and bold and sneaky strong, its big on flavor but its not super heavy to drink as these go, and the alcohol isnt really a factor for me, substantial but it still doesnt quite drink like a double. a little more color than expected actually, a dull rusty orange tint to it, not just a washed out yellow, hazy and dense looking but not messy, creamy white head of average height. the aroma is killer, i think the galaxy is in front of the citra, key lime, green melon, candied lemon, green tea, really fresh and bold, early onset too, hits right away, well supported by the citra, which is where i think citra does its best work, lemon curd, lemongrass, and a hint of white coconut, delicious and clean on top of a starchy earthy grain base that brings just a little bready richness and cereal sweetness to the mix. the flavor is like the nose, both hops rather robust and doing their thing, a little bit of green burn in the center but its only there for a flash and then its smoother, rounded out by a fresh grain profile and a little bit of residual sugar which does soften it. oily on the palate. definite lime and lime leaf to me, herbal with hints of sage and verbena, lemony too from the citra, really nicely designed, warms up well, has adequate carbonation, and really is low on the bitterness for being as hop forward as it is. light vanilla and honey later too, sexy in that way, fluffy feeling but not huge, smooth and wide and long. ill always be most jazzed on their saison and wild types, but this is real good."
Society & Solitude #4,4.41,"On tap at Sabatinis in Exeter pa early this evening.

Usual splendid look from HF. Hazy mid orange body, small white head, perfect rings of lacing. Aroma mildly hoppy and tropical. On tasting, anything but mild. Smooth, hoppy, warming, great balance. Finish is where HF really shines. Progression of hoppy, tropical, sweet, warming, then that late bitter note.

Overall, a perfectly enjoyable beer at the end of a shift moving beer around."
Society & Solitude #4,4.3,"On tap at the Bench.

Presents hazy gold with a half-inch head of white. Moderate retention and lacing.
Fairly pungent in the nose with peach, mango, white grape.
Medium bodied with a soft mouthfeel.
Orange, peach, mango on the palate. Finishes with minimal malt, a balancing bitterness, and fairly juicy."
Society & Solitude #4,4.19,"A very good IPA but really stunned it scored 100. Seems like BA is throwing out 100’s like candy to kids at Halloween.
Definitely a very good IPA with a citrus and a little sour flavor but still smooth. Again a really good IPA but just not top notch like a Heady."
Society & Solitude #4,4.58,"Had on tap at Rivercrest in Astoria NY. Deep yellow haze, really nice white leaving on the glass. Citrus, dank, resins nose… orange peel, peach. Taste is huge waves of hops, light orange peel bitterness, cracker breadiness in the background… just delicious"
Lou Pepe - Framboise,4.64,Enjoyed this in Brussels. Love raspberry and the Lambic balance was excellent. The beer is relatively acidic to the mouth so be prepared. Love this as a desert .
Lou Pepe - Framboise,3.5,"750 ml corked and capped bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 5%. Made with 300 g of raspberries per liter beer. Clear signal red colour, moderate pink head. Intense aroma of raspberries (no surprise). The flavour is very sour with notes of lemons and raspberries, fairly dry and crisp."
Abricot Du Fermier,3.81,"Another super tart fruited wild ale from Side Project. This one shares a lot in common with Fuzzy. Expressive aromas of apricot, yellow peach, lemon candy, sweet floral, and honey. Flavors are mostly lemon warheads with a bit of apricot and pale malts around the edges. Clean and tart

77/100"
Abricot Du Fermier,4.68,"L: Pours a very strong pale orange yellow with no head and no lacing on the glass.

S: A nice toasted oak leads off, followed by a nice hint of Brett, some nice apricot and notes of sour tartness, very nice aroma.

T: A strong Brett and apricot mixes with lots of sour and tart, and a nice strong toasted oak. Amazing golden sour.

F: Smooth medium body and good carbonation.

O: This is a world class golden sour ale."
Abricot Du Fermier,4.57,"Look - slightly hazy orange with a great thick white head and sticky lacing and rimming
Smell - tart candied apricot woody
Taste - for SP, not as tart as some. Still tart but pretty great. candied Apricot and woody like the smell
Feel - Medium body and carb, slight creamy... lasting tingle afterwards
Overall - really fantastic beer!!!"
Abricot Du Fermier,4.4,"Appearance - The beer was the color of an apricot. It was golden orange with some red hues. Carbonation was visible.

Smell - The apricot seemed dry in the nose, but you could easily can detect a funk of a saison.

Taste - At the front, the apricots were quite sour. It really tingled the sides of the tongue. There was an undercurrent of fruit sweetness. Toward the back, the funk of the saison came through and provides a sense of balance.

Mouthfeel - The body was vicious, almost like an actual fruit smoothie.

Overall - I can definitely appreciate a saison like this."
Cable Car,4.55,"2020 Vintage.

Clear golden coloration; soft white head of carbonation settles in a thin ring around the beer.

The nose opens with a musty sweetness and candied lemon peel. Really nice balance of funk and citrus.

The palate is tart and predominantly fruity, with a bit of a tightening pucker on the back of the palate and a long, mildly acidic finish. Nice juiciness to the overall profile.

A touch of dryness, with a soft finish and gentle lingering tannin."
Cable Car,4.53,"2019 version, drank 06.19.22 out of a Hill Farmstead bulbous wine glass. Straw color with very delicate islands of head but other than that, not to much there. Not too much nose either. Funky and acidy taste, strong. Very pungent, strong and tasty. Pretty amazing beer. Just wow."
Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.45,"2024 Release - Nice deep brown color, great chocolate, leather, raisen and spice aroma. Definitely some heat from the cinnamon and peppers, but pretty balanced by the prominent barrel flavor which comes through nice as it warms. A bit thin and would prefer a little thicker feel, but overall a pretty darn good stout like most voodoo. Can see why this is highly rated."
Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.38,"Had on tap. So excited to be able to try this, and simultaneously did and did not live up to the hype. Viscous black oil pour, no head save a thin brown ring. Bourbon, coconut, peppers, cinnamon, to a lesser degree cardamom, bake into the chocolate and vanilla base with maple in the nose. Taste does most the same but the bourbon and wood are thrown into the back seat, finishes chewy and drier. This is where the hype conversation comes in. Is it a great beer? Yes. Hype met, however is it better than other elite representations of this style? No, hype not met. Seen most in the feel where it has great spice, smooth malts and gooey adjuncts textures, but the barrel is not super assertive, want more mass but love the dry chewy nature. An experience worth having"
Oude Geuze Vintage,4.77,"2016, 375 capped and caged poured into a HOTD tulip."
Oude Geuze Vintage,4.35,"Vintage 2019 No 116-18/19
Solid amber orange color with no head.
Nice funky sour aroma with notes of horse sweat, grapefruit, Belgian old hops and faint malt.
Flavor with notes of lemon, white pepper, lactic acid, grapefruit, aged Belgian hops and dark berries. Dry sour long aftertaste.
Light to medium body with perfect carbonation of tiniest bubbles. Alcohol of 6.8% is completely absent.
Superbly balanced Oude Geuze with assertive grapefruit and aged Belgian hops notes."
Oude Geuze Vintage,4.79,"2012 vintage, 37,5cl bottle with no label, at the brewery in the Lot neighborhood of Beersel just outside of Brussels on the S2 line. The aromas are not of this world. Like funky cheese and aged fruit and some serious old barn. Plus the subtle wood of the barrel comes through. Wow. The acidity and the way it puckers your cheeks. This is simply incredible. Aged perfectly."
Oude Geuze Vintage,4.98,"375ml Bottle 2016 - pours a cloudy dirty orange with 1.5 finger foam head that dissipates to leave good lacing. On the nose it is incredibly complex with sour notes of vinegar/white wine, followed by fruitiness and funk & pepperiness. Taste wise, incredibly complex but follows the nose (you can understand why it's complex so!). Beautifully balanced nonetheless and an astonishing gueuze, definitely on of the best I've had, if not the best (and priced accordingly!)."
Oude Geuze Vintage,4.85,2016 edition from last year. 375 ml bottle. A little oak on the nose. Just enough carbonation to make the mouthfeel great. Taste makes me want to drink it all day.
Zombie Dust,4.58,Probably the best American pale ale I have tried. The perfect balance of caramel malt and hops. Pine citrus and malt in the aroma. Just enough of a hoppy bitterness in taste.
Zombie Dust,4.26,"Showed up today in my local ShopRite, packaged 8/24/24.
By miracle of the beer Gods, in NJ a week later.
Smooth and tasty pale ale.
One of the best when fresh."
Zombie Dust,4.1,"Look: orange in color with a frothy 1"" head that slow falls.

Smell: some mild citrus and fruit sweetness is picked up by the nose.

Taste: grapefruit, lemon, some peach tones, with some late arriving mild pine flavors.

Mouthfeel: nicely crisp throughout. Bitterness arrives at the finish.

Overall: a solid pale ale that is well balanced and flavorful."
Zombie Dust,4.6,"L - Golden with a good amount of clarity and a frothy white head that sticks around a bit leaving behind a good amount of lacing
S - floral, piney hops with a ton of sweet malt, cracker, some citrus (grapefruit),
T - follows the nose - floral, piney hops intermixed well with tons of malt, crackers, slight caramel
F - medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth yet crisp
O - probably the best pale ale out there"
Zombie Dust,4.26,"Poured from a 12 ounce can into a Shaker pint glass, ""PKGD ON"" date is ""05/21/24"".

APPEARANCE: pours a cloudy, amber color with a beautiful two-finger, off-white head with excellent retention, the head eventually receded until a thin, unbroken layer of small bubbles remained throughout, medium carbonation and very heavy lacing on the glass, this is how beer is supposed to look.

SMELL: bread and pineapple citrus, very pleasant to the nose.

TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially sweet pineapple citrus and then bread, the hops pleasantly lingered.

PALATE: this beer has average carbonation for the style but is creamy on the palate.

OVERALL: this is a terrific beer, it may be one of the best looking beers you can find, the taste is very pleasant but it's not especially complex, I see why this beer would be rated highly but it might be one of those beers that is overly hyped, having said that it's easily one of the best APA's I have had, I will definitely buy this again and would enthusiastically recommend to anyone who enjoys the style."
Zombie Dust,4.54,"Clear bright amber color with a very respectable white head with good retention and some nice lacing.
The aroma is pale malt and citrus.
The taste is hop forward, grapefruit, hints of lemon, lime and tangerine with a nice light caramel malt background, a touch of light toast, more than moderate bitterness but nicely balanced. The finish is dry with lingering citrus zest and a touch of pine.
The body is light/medium, moderate carbonation, smooth and very drinkable.
Altogether, this is an outstanding pale ale, nice balance, very tasty and highly enjoyable. I wish this was more available locally."
Zombie Dust,4.47,"I'm not sure why I really do these beer reviews because I'm sure nobody reads them except myself on occasion, so it's sort of like a diary on beer. So when it comes to zombie dust, it's pretty much all been said before. Is this a 100, I have no idea why it is but it's close. Instead of describing the nuances of this beer I'm going to say one thing about it and that is the absolute pinpoint focus of the flavor. Not flabby nor multiple layers of hops but absolute concentrated monolithic and excruciatingly focused in character and flavor. For me that's what makes it so enjoyable an unusually impressive. Drink on."
Focal Banger,4.28,"Poured (I know, sacrilege) chilled 45F into a 16oz pint glass.
Appearance is deep gold with notable haze, true to the style. 1/4"" creamy white head that leaves a fair amount of lacing.
Aroma is tropical fruit, resin and pine.
Taste follows the nose with an immense punch of hoppy flavor to the palette. Grapefruit, dank resin and pine. Even a hint of tobacco on the backend. Nice crispness from the grain bill and the amount of carbonation which I would describe as medium carbonation. There is a bit of peppery hop bitterness that lingers...washes out any malty sweetness or lack thereof. I want to say this is balanced with sweet/bitter due to the mouth tackiness/stickiness, but I'm have a hard time finding sweetness beneath the enormous hop profile. But that's not a terrible thing as my rating reflects. This is a well-crafted beer that the brewer makes work. Body is slightly on the full side of medium.
Overall, very tasty beer, true to the style, that was worth the money and I would buy again."
Focal Banger,5.0,Not as malty as Heady Topper. More modern NE IPA. The smell is out of this world. Fantastic. Currently my favourite.
Focal Banger,4.24,Nice IPA!
Focal Banger,4.9,"Definitely my favorite beer, extremely tasty."
Focal Banger,4.46,"Top notch IPA...IMHO better and more well rounded than Heady Topper. Lacks the juiciness of beers from Treehouse or Trillium, but has a resinous edge those brewers don't hit."
Focal Banger,4.77,"Canned on 04/04/24. Poured a golden orange hue into a Samuel Smith imperial pint glass with a 2 finger creamy head that lingers for a little and leaves a descent amount of lacing. Nose is juicy with undertones of mango, passion fruit & pineapple; bready malts also present. Flavor is citrus and juicy but a bit rounder and not quite as bitter as a west coast; hop forward but much more tame finish (caramel sweetness). Moderate carbonation with a medium body & feel. A well crafted beer that lives up to the hype. Very, very enjoyable."
Focal Banger,4.32,Overrated.
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.0,"Review from 2018 on untappd: What a time to be alive. Finally getting to try this and I have much better shelfies available. Don't get me wrong. Good beer. Not great.

Ha! What a review! Would love to revisit"
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.48,"2019 (10th anniversary) vintage. Not the best stout I've had, by far, but certainly a fantastic brew. Highly recommend!"
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.41,"I haven't tried many of this type of beer to make a fair comparison, but I can see why this has received so much love. Hole-a mole-a sauce this is tasty. Up front the bitter baker's chocolate is accented nicely by earthy vanilla, mild pepper, and faint spice. The chilli kicks up significantly heading into the finish, pretty much right into my heat sweet spot. Just a great beer that I am so glad to try, thanks beergoot!"
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.13,"From a 500ml bottle, dated 03/11/23. Served in a spiegelau tulip glass.

Pours a thin-appearing oak-brown with no obvious highlights. A generous finger of lush, coffee colored foam doesn’t last but maybe 20 seconds leaving a narrow collar and a rousable spatter of oily, super-slippery lacing.

Nose is… fruity? A sweet, candy-like coffee aroma and, totally unexpectedly, raspberry - which must be an olfactory hallucination, or at least how my brain is interpreting the combination of vanilla, cinnamon and chiles.

Taste is sweet but not heavily so, with a berry-like coffee bean flavour and that fruity mélange of cinnamon-vanilla-chile pepper that my brain persists in translating as ‘raspberry’ bringing a brightness and lightness which keeps the beer from tasting syrupy. A slick Cadbury-like milk chocolatey character becomes more evident as the beer warms accompanied by some heat from the chiles. There’s a very faint soy sauce quality in the aftertaste which doesn’t detract much.

Feel is oily-smooth and creamy-slick, medium bodied but a little light relative to the style with gentle, prickly carbonation. Chile heat builds up on the palate somewhat and amplifies the otherwise mild carbonation, lightening the mouthfeel further.

Overall, pretty good but maybe a little bit of a mixed bag. I won’t call the flavours ‘muddled,’ but it is a very ‘busy’ flavour profile which, weirdly, for my palate, comes across very fruity and raspberry-like."
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,3.99,"2022 pint can, chilled, left to warm. Flat black on the pour, thick, sticky, tiny bit of struggled foam that vanished fast.
Smells like cinnamon, vanilla, cacao nibs, and chilli peppers being muddled together.
Tastes the same. Just too much going on. Cloyingly sweet and thick, slightly gritty, too much cinnamon, and who needs hot peppers in their stout?
Overall, I’ve attended 5 Hunahpu’s Day celebrations at the CCB Spruce Street brewery over the years and have bought a bottle or can each time and come away thinking the same thing: nice novelty.,. but way too busy and quite over rated."
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.33,"2020 vintage received courtesy of @roguer.

Appearance is typical for the style, which means it's a nice looking dark, dark brown with a half inch of tan colored head. Nice legs. Aroma is wonderfully rich and decadent, but not in an artificial way. Plenty of sweet molasses, chocolate, a hint of vanilla, and some faint figs / raisins. That description doesn't do this any real justice, so in summary, this beer smells great.

Taste is interesting. Nowhere near as sweet on the nose, with some naturally bitter cacao notes, cinnamon and pepper combining brilliantly with the base beer. The spiciness is Goldilocks.....just right. A bit less and they wouldn't be notable. A bit more and they would overpower. There's a really nice sweetness deep into the finish that helps add to the complexity of this beer. Fully bodies and smooth, leaving a really nice coating on the tongue with a pleasant alcohol warming.

Overall this is excellent."
Green,4.65,"L - Hazy, opaque, creamy straw well with a creamy white head that dissipates somewhat slow, leaving a thin cap and a ton of lacing
S - Fresh, piney, grassy hops right up front with some tropical fruit notes
T - follows the nose - fresh, piney, grassy hops up front and throughout followed by tropical fruit notes - pineapple and a good amount of citrus - grapefruit and tangerine. Some floral notes as well
F - medium, leaning on full bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth.
O - Much more hop forward than Haze or Julius. Haze felt like the fullest, softest body with minimal hop bite and peach and passion fruit whereas Julius seemed to have a much stronger citrus kick with slight hops while still retaining a full body, whereas Green seems to have a thinner body while being much more hop forward and less of a juice bomb."
Green,4.72,"6/23/24 On tap at the Charlton location. Finally made it!

Server was great and helpful.

Pineapple and pink grapefruit flood the nose along with some pine and lactose aromas.

Perfectly sweet and bitter at the same time, what's not to love? Definite flavors of lemon rind, pineapple, and pine. Such an intense, fresh hop ending."
Green,4.0,May be biased as I consumed after drinking TH “haze”. I would rate this as a slightly better version of harpoon IPA. Flavor was solid but disappointing compared to the juice bombs TH has built their name on. I would say this aligns w/ the WCIPA flavor profile.
Green,4.65,Julius or Green as my TH favorite? Both are superb. Need to do some more work here.
Green,4.24,"Canned 5/20

I get a lot of citrus, more pithy than juicy, and some underripe nectarine and peach. There is an usually stiff bitterness for the style at the finish. Almost WCIPAish in nature. Good stuff."
Green,3.07,"I had this beer at the main location in Charlton. First - I asked the server for a west coast IPA, and Green is clearly not that - but that is comment on the server, not the beer. I also like New England IPAs. My reason for the negative review is the beer was very, I'll say harsh on the tongue. It overwhelmed any appreciation for the taste that I may have had. I don't know if they got the carbonation wrong in that batch or what, but I got a distinct (and unpleasant) tingling feeling on my tongue. I dunno - I see this beer is highly rated. I've had a similar sensation from other IPAs from time to time - perhaps a particular hop causes my tongue to react that way, or maybe it was the particular batch? Or maybe I'm right and everyone else is wrong (LoL)."
Green,4.41,"Poured from the can into a Spiegeual IPA glass. Canned Dec 18th 2023.

Classic frothy and rich forming fine tall four to three finger big head. Small bubbles and cream white with a tellow like shine to the top and some island like retention. Pale orange solid body, with a hint of shine and maybe some yellow hues.

Creamy sensing aroma. Mild touches of light herbs to pine and citrus oils with excellent hop forward presentation. Creamy hinting vanilla, maybe even some biscuity malt notes which make for a real good bakery dessert like quality. Quite nice nose here.

Palate is really wonderful. Big hinting touches of cream vanilla mixing with herbal sage and some big touches of green earth. Supportive real rich malt backbone with an excellent young green hop angle but doesn't come out biting or painful. The finish is the most impressive thing, chewy pastry like sweet malt mixing touches of icing sugar, with building mint that gets menthol like hot in the perfect building intensity. Excellent malt surprising presentation that slow comes to fruition after some time also.

Really well crafted IPA. Doesn't have a real distinct nose but it's flavor is first rate and world class."
Haze,4.64,"L - Hazy, opaque straw yellow with a creamy white head that sticks around a bit leaving behind a ton of lacing
S - peach, pineapple, and papaya along with piney hops, juicy fruit gum
T - follows the nose - peach, papaya, and pineapple juicy fruit intermixed well with relatively soft, piney hops, some floral notes, and a decent amount of malt to tie things together
F - full bodied with moderate carbonation. Creamy and pillowy soft
O - a truly great NEIPA. Treehouse really has this style nailed down"
Haze,4.99,16oz can from Sandwich location. Taste and smell is transcendent. Cannot believe how mellow this is on the palate considering the ABV. Incredible
Haze,4.49,Have had this beer dozens of times throughout the years still delicious but nothing like the smaller batch brews from MONSON i really miss those days
Haze,4.48,"At first glance this beer doesn’t appear that it is going to be decent let alone, good. Off yellow with almost a hint of green this extra hazy ipa lives up to the name. The nose is the first indication that something is a miss here. Tropical fruits orange and peach shine through a subtle floral scent. We all drink beef for the taste and this one delivers. Again the citrus tropical lead the way and give way to a slight bitter hop. A smooth mouthfeel makes this an easy drinker that can be enjoyed beyond its ABV."
Haze,4.54,"Surely this rocked the boat when it was first released ten years ago, but being widely available in 2024, coupled with every brewery in the country trying their hand at NE haze, it would appear some of the luster has faded.

That's bullshit. This is delicious. Thick, creamy, opaque juice with heavy lacing and just enough flavor to get your fix without drinking puree.

Glad to finally get the chance to try it. It won't be the last time."
Haze,4.46,"Beautiful golden Haze with a nice white foam on top

The nose is a bit on mute but still some fruits

The taste is great with a nice fruit punch and light bitterness that balance the slight sweetness

The mouthfeel IS very nice, velvety and not overly carbonated

Overall a great NEIPA even if I'd love to try it fresher (canned on 11.06.23)"
Haze,4.89,"IMHO this is a better beer than Julious and Green as well as their ""very"" cousins and should be in the top ten NEIPA. Such a perfect balance of taste and feel."
Haze,3.56,Pretty freaking decent. Probably fantastic on draft. Bit of a harsh aftertaste
Cable Car Kriek,4.46,"750ml bottle, 2021 release, poured into a stemless wine glass. Enjoyed on 05.04.2024, reviewed from Tasting Journal.

The beer pours a nice salmon pink color, amber and ruby hues, nice clarity with a fizzy off-white head, no retention nor lacing. The aroma is nice, tart cherry, oak, citrus, vanilla, quite floral, soft grain, lots of funk, and mineral water. The flavors are great, funky oak, bright cherry juice, vinous grape, citrus, wildflower, berry fruits, vanilla, and mineral water. The mouthfeel is good, coating, crisp, tart and tangy with a lighter medium body, lively dry finish.

Verdict: A really nice ""kriek"" style wild from The Lost Abbey. The cherry is the star and is expressed very well. Bright, delicate, tart, great depth to the cherry with nice barrel character."
Cable Car Kriek,4.65,"OG. Murky pale red appearance with loose bubbly light light pink fast fleeting head. Nose and palate is bold and jammy cherry, cherry skin, slight funk, oak, and tastefully tart. Moderate body and carbonation, creamy mouthfeel. Held up amazingly well."
Cable Car Kriek,4.44,"2021 vintage

Review 2100! For this next landmark review I got my hands on the seemingly rare yet highly rated Cable Car Kriek. I haven't had anything from Lost Abbey in quite some time either (exactly 1000 reviews ago apparently), so I'm excited to try this legendary Kriek. Let's pop it open and find out what it's all about

Pours a cloudy reddish orange with just a few pinkish white bubbles that quickly fade to nothing and obviously leaves no lacing

It's so fruit forward and tart in the nose. Not too much funk but that's fine by me. I'm picking up on aromas of sour cherry, apple cider vinegar, sharp oak, lemon zest, crackery malt, jammy blackberry, lime zest, and light red wine

In taste it's much brighter and I'm all about it. A bit more funk is present here but still nothing crazy. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting sour cherry, cherry pit, lemon juice, crackery malt, almond, lime zest, brown sugar, sharp oak, apple skin, and light leather. The swallow brings notes of sour cherry, dry oak, jammy blackberry, lemon juice, tannic red wine, crackery malt, almond, and light brown sugar

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp beer. Finishes bone dry and refreshing

This one is awesome. Absolutely worth seeking out if you like Krieks"
Cable Car Kriek,3.16,"2021 vintage. Ruby red body with surprisingly little carbonation and no head whatsoever. Aromas are pretty standard kriek: cherry pie, lemon, hay, bit of vinegar. Very little funk, which is a bit unusual. Flavors are acetic but also semi-sweet, with predominant notes of cherry and apple cider vinegar. Feel is slippery and a bit flat due to the low carbonation. Overall I think this is one of those beers that made waves upon release when the idea of Belgian lambics was still relatively unknown in the US, but now that we have broader access to some of the best Belgium offerings here in the states it doesn't quite hold up. Especially given the price point ($90/750ml), I would not buy this again but happy to have the opportunity.

64/100"
Cable Car Kriek,4.33,2021
Cable Car Kriek,4.28,"2021 Vintage.

Gorgeous ruby red pour; very few agitated bubbles of carbonation as it’s poured into the glass. It settles flat.

The nose is still distinctly Cable Car, with noticeable yet restrained funk and lemony citrus. The cherry adds more brightness and is a fresh, fruity addition. With time, a lot of oak and Brett comes to the forefront.

The palate is sour and noticeably acidic, with a surprisingly low carbonation. Was definitely hoping for more of it to cut that tart cherry and acid, but overall it’s never overwhelming. The tannin from the cherry works really well with the overall profile.

As stated above, not sure if that much carb was lost since 2021 or it was just never very high, but I felt it needed more. That said, it drinks bright and refreshing, with restrained tannin."
Doppelganger,4.73,"16 oz. can dated 7/22/24

Golden orange pond murk. Three fingers variegated white head. Full lacing curtains and surface cap. Nothing floating or hanging out in the bottom of the can.
Grapefruit, sour pineapple, peach aromas.
Pine, grapefruit, apricot, tangerine flavors.
Soft full mouthfeel with a bitter aftertaste lurking that keeps things interesting. Good stubborn carbonation.
Everything that I love about Alter Ego with a little more hop kick."
Doppelganger,4.56,"Look - hazy slightly tan yellow sticky lacing and rimming
Smell - boom, peach, mango, citrus
Taste - tropical stone fruit citrus, delicious
Feel - medium full body creamy light carb
Overall - really fantastic"
Doppelganger,4.4,"Poured from a can into a teku glass
Appearance – The beer pours a super hazy orange-yellow color with a thick head of off-white foam. The head has a fantastic level of retention, fading slowly over time and leaving tons of streaky lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is heaviest of an orange juice and tropical fruit smell of papaya, mango, and pineapple. Along with these smells is lots of guava and tangerine, along with some herbal hops and a nice showing of grapefruit and pine. Other notes of a bready and doughy smell as well as some tropical fruit candy and some peach and apricot.
Taste – The taste begins with a bready and doughy malt flavor paired with lots of the tropical flavors that were in the nose. There is a big showing of papaya, guava, and tangerine, along with some pineapple and orange juice. There is a bit of a pine and herbal hop upfront, with a decent showing of grapefruit. As the taste advances the pine and herb get stronger, while the grapefruit fades a tad. Some peach and apricot, replace a bit of the tropical fruits, with some notes of earth and dirt joining in as well. There is a touch of pepper and spice, and a hint of booze and wood that come on at the end, leaving one with a rich and juicy taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is quite thick and chewy with a carbonation level that is slightly lower. For the rich and big flavors of the brew, the feel is excellent, coating the tongue in all the big flavors of the brew.
Overall – A quite nice hazy indeed. This ranks up there with the other big scorers for tree house and is certainly one to try."
Doppelganger,4.54,"From a can dated 3/13/24. Wow! A fabulous NEDIPA from Tree House. The aroma of tropical fruit and dankness was deliciously powerful. Maybe just a tad overly bitter on the finish, but one the best I’ve had from Tree House."
Doppelganger,3.4,"Not bad, not amazing though. Another good tree house beer though, for sure."
Doppelganger,4.49,"Pint can poured into a stemmed tulip IPA glass.

Murky thick apricot colored creamsicle. 1-plus F white cap with waves of lacing.

Juicy citrus and tropical fruit aromas. Pineapple, orange, and grapefruit. It’s dank and dry.

Positive juice flavors follow the aromas. Soaked malt with citrus variety led by grapefruit.

Dense yet flowing juice feel. The sweetness come through the hops and kicks out bitterness. Full and smooth.

Strong neipa version."
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,4.49,"Pours a beautiful dense yellow colour.

Smell is quite particular, citrus, fruit. Not something I've smelled before, but very nice. Maybe some pineapple.

Taste is exactly the same.

No bitterness, and good mouth feel for the abv. Excellent stuff."
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,4.62,"Look - hazy pale yellow with a white head and sticky lacing and rimming
Smell - juicy citrus floral, boom
Taste - same as the smell, pretty green. Slight tropical in there to
Feel - medium light body and carb
Overall - pretty fantastic"
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,4.55,"Had the non DDH version recently, so splurged for the even more pricey DDH variant for comparison - spoiler alert - Double Dry Hopping can be beneficial!
Pours out a dense milky pale whitish golden with a finger plus of creamy white head that fades to a small covering and rim. This is a good looking hazy, though to my sensibilities I always lean to clear beer - personal preference....
Aromatics burst from the glass with huge citrus, mango and tropical notes; some cantaloupe musk and a sweaty dankness with herbal green undertones.
Taste is sweet with ripe pineapple, over ripe orange, grapefruit and a green dank and sweaty herbal flavour - moderate resinous bitterness that compliments the fruity flavours.
Solid medium mouthfeel with very decent carbonation and a bittersweetness that sits briefly at the finish.
Honestly not generally a hazy fan but this rivals Jade Dust from Pure Project as my all time favourite in the class (am I wrong - this is really an IPA, no?)."
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,4.54,"From a 16oz can dated 03/05/24

Murky, hazy, and dank looking golden pouring beer. A frothy and fluffy 2 finger white head that has great retention, and some good lacing on the glass.
The nose starts hitting as I poured the beer with a melon aroma. Lots of cantaloupe in the nose, with other tropical notes. I also get a hint of a grassy aroma.
Taste - Full on cantaloupe flavor in this beer. This flavor hits right away and lingers. I also get an earthy, and grassy flavor up front that mellows out as it goes on.
The body is off the chart smooth, full, creamy, and soft.
Damn amazing beer overall, and a pleasure to try."
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,4.22,"L: classic orange super hazy, medium white head
S: fresh mango and pineapple, white grape juice, tropical fruit
T: orange and grapefruit peel,, orange, some mango, vegetal hop pine bitterness, dry
O: very good lighter bodied NEIPA, taste is less tropical/juicy than expected and more dry and resinous"
Swish,4.02,Pours a cloudy golden orange with a finger of foamy head that slowly dissipates to a thin ring with some lacing. Aroma of tropical fruit and citrus. Taste follows nose.
Swish,4.3,"16oz can dated 5/7/24.

Pours murky gold with a half-inch head of white. Moderate retention and lacing. Dank and citrusy in the nose. White grapes, lemon-lime, unripe peach. Medium bodied with a soft mouthfeel. Pine, unripe pineapple, white peaches on the palate. Finishes with a touch of malt and a balancing bitterness."
Swish,4.2,"Poured a golden body with minimal head and minor lace patches. Aroma has notes that range from tropical fruits to mild and earthy hops. Medium, fuller body, balances a slight dankness with earthy, dry hops that are low-key bitter and there's a full tropical fruit sweetness (almost like fruit punch there are so many flavors), but not too sweet and a touch of bitterness on clean finish helps beer and this is easily a beer I'd recommend."
Swish,4.65,"Pale, opaque orange with thin tan head. Standard hazy look. Smell is complex with pithy rind, orange, vanilla, and malts. Similar smell to some of the Hill Farmstead IPAs. Extremely bright taste with tons of tropical, sweet notes however has a nice bitterness at the end. Pleasing feel that doesn't linger too long. Swish is a spectacular hazy that stands uniquely in a sea of copy cats."
Swish,4.59,"Bissell Brothers is the Larry Bird/Magic Johnson of breweries to me. Not a knock at all, but my MJ is the Alchemist. That being said, the Swish drops in to my stomach like a Steph Curry logo 3 point shot. Nothing but net, all swish. Beautiful Laker gold color. Completely opaque with a slight bubbly froth. On the nose you get Phoenix Suns orange with some Miami Heat tropical pineapple notes. Was expecting a thick Shaq like body but it’s a more lean medium body, reminiscent of a Dwight Howard. Taste wise you get the traditional IPA bitter hop bite that gives a slight Celtics green herby taste. However it also has that new wave NEIPA melon, cream, citrus fruit flavor. The NEIPA is the new dynasty, the Golden State Warriors of the beer industry. What an absolute treat, go Nuggets."
Swish,4.62,"(16 oz can, 011073 04-17-23; purchased cold 4-pk at the brewery 2 days ago... poured into my Trillium fat tulip)

L: impenetrably-hazy, pale yellow-amber liquid with mildly golden highlights on the fringes... moderately tall foam rise on the pour, sinking back into a misty cap... bit of a letdown from the lame head retention and little lacing

S: lime hull, lemon peel, mango funk, grapefruit pith; slight capsicum spicy accent... cream of wheat... vibrant greenness cutting through the perfumy fruits... the booze does boost the contact and seduction

T: much more malt and mush than I'd anticipated, and it's great!; floral rush halfway, morphing into a tropical cleaver into the finish, during which a powdery grain flour note swells up and hangs up front long into the aftertaste... almost halfway through and wow! did the tropical hopping burst back onto my palate, fresh and enlivening... masterpiece of balance for its ilk

F: only a faint sense of alcohol at the back of the palate; the milky grains and silky hop resins team to tame the heat I suppose... I wouldn't go any higher with the abv for this style; 7.5% is usually my sweet spot, and this is just tickling the tonsils, just inching toward unnecessary noxious-ity

O: not a fan of hazies, but this shot right up into my top 3 or 4; they really do have a good thing going as I've very much enjoyed the unique character of each brand I've tried from them... I could definitely see getting this again (good excuse for another beer run to Maine); it has a lot going on for the style; some depth and dimension to the gritty grain bill; too smooth and moreish (2122)"
Swish,4.41,"Pours a very hazy gold with a thumb of cream colored head. Average head retention & lacing; thought I had a clean glass???

S: Citrus & tropical fruits, nice nose

T: Oranges, dryness, mangoes, dryness & green melons & strawberry up front. Mangoes, peaches, green melon & a little acidic pineapple, plus a little dryness as this beer warms, Finishes a little dry with plenty of pineapple, green melon & strawberry

MF: Medium body, restrained carbonation, nicely balanced, acidity on the tongue

A brilliant take on the style, pretty juicy"
I Let My Tape Rock,4.9,"#199, yum!"
I Let My Tape Rock,4.5,"BBA from Wakefest 2022
Pours dark and fairly thick, minimal head. Has some coconut floaters. Massive chocolate aroma mixes with light coffee and sweet vanilla; coconut lingers on the finish. Flavor is molten chocolate espresso lava cake, chocolate covered coconut flakes, I get a little cherry cordials on the finish. Thick and creamy, yet there is a hint of lively carbonation. Overall an amazing beer, a year old and the coconut is still there.

I Let My Tape Rock,4.8,"Batch 1: Glad to have tried this coconut dreamboat! Coconut rocks abound, plus rich vanilla, cocoa, maple, and awesome rye to balance everything out. Super thicc, old school JWB mouthfeel; super impressed by this gem!"
I Let My Tape Rock,4.69,Had in 2018 was probably my favorite J. Wakefield to date. Great collaboration of flavors and enjoyed this a lot. Thought feel could have been a little better.
Triple Shot,4.65,"Look - black thick, but not syrup, great tan head rimming lacing…. As good as it gets!
Smell - roasted malts and coffee
Taste - coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malts
Feel - full body fizz lighter carb, great mouth coat
Overall - best coffee stout I can remember"
Triple Shot,4.43,"Canned 2/2022. I'm pleasantly surprised by how sweet this isn't, just a hint of rich semi-sweet chocolate at finish. The nutty, roasty base makes for a wonderful coffee showcase throughout."
Triple Shot,4.53,"Appearance - The beer poured a deep black color with an inch of tan head.

Smell - The beer smelled like fresh roasted coffee with roasted bean notes and chocolate in the profile.

Taste - Overall, this was like espresso with a huge body. There were notes of fresh roasted coffee, fudge, chocolate ice cream, and just a hint of vanilla. The sweetness came out more in the finish. In the big picture, it was an assault of espresso.

Mouthfeel - The beer had a nice thick clingy body. It allowed the bitterness to linger.

Overall - This was a really nice stout with a lot of coffee. Finding a more intense coffee stout would be a challenge."
Triple Shot,4.38,"Nice dark black color with outstanding brown foam and lacing. Smell is nothing to write home about—water, slight roasted malts and a faint sweet coffee.but it tastes fantastic: deep coffee tones permeate throughout and a sweet molasses cover a base of toasty malt stout. Cheers."
West Ashley,4.25,"Taster at bottle share. Pale pinkish /orange hue with a few bubbles. Aroma is stone fruit, apricots. Taste is tart, fruity, apricots, full. not overly sour."
West Ashley,4.28,"Had on tap. Cloudy pale yellow pour with a pearl white head. Barnyard funk, big citrus, apricot, bright oak and faint flowers in the nose. Taste is much the same, moderate potency amongst a delicate and artful body. Otherwise sour with beautiful oak texture, bright and medium bodied with a kiss of acidity"
Ephraim,4.21,"Double-digit ABV IPAs have come a long way. Early versions tended to run hot and syrupy, unable to hide the booze, while modern versions seem to almost go out of their way to disguise their potency.

It's a major credit to Hill Farmstead that, well over a decade into this beer's existence, they haven't tinkered with the recipe and execution to chase trends. While the result has some boozy bite and a slightly syrupy feel to it, it's original and authentic.

Crystal clear golden body. Very good head production and retention, especially given the ABV; better retention might have nudged this beer into perfect appearance territory.

Nose is very potent and hoppy, but it's so over the top that it's a touch muddled and indistinct. Resin certainly leads the way, followed by brighter pine, flowers, mild dankness, and a blend of fruity hops that lean slightly tropical. Malt presents notes of honey, toast, and white bread.

Flavor follows remarkably close to the nose. Alcohol bite is impossible to ignore, but it's not so aggressive as to turn the sip unpleasant. While I mentioned that this one is a touch syrupy, there's plenty of liveliness on the palate, regardless. You're still obviously drinking an IPA, not a barleywine or stout; it just happens to be a double-digit ABV IPA. Tasting notes include orange marmalade, resin, honey, white bread, and a melange of tropical fruit, citrus, and berries. Wonderfully bitter.

As much credit as I give this beer for staying true to concept, it's also impossible to ignore that in many ways the brewing world has caught up to, if not Hill Farmstead, at least their take on this style of beer. I wonder if I could tell much difference between this beer and SN Hoptimum (probably the closest (II)IPA parallel in terms of both flavor profile and mouthfeel). It's an excellent beer, outstanding really, and perhaps 10 years ago it would have blown my mind - but today, it'll have to settle for ""impressive."""
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.46,"22 ounce bottle into a snifter. The 2022 edition, had 4/27/24.

Pours a dark brown, mostly opaque, with a one inch foamy head and a decent amount of foamy lacing. Aromas of cinnamon, roasted malt, bourbon, coffee as it warms, chocolate, some oak. Has a bit of a spicy aroma. Flavors of bourbon, coffee, cinnamon, roasted malt, chocolate. Has a bit of a spicy taste. Smooth, a very good fuller body, well carbonated.

Liked this more when fully warmed. The cinnamon is the most prominent overall, but it’s not overdone. The coffee shows better in the flavor. Has a good barrel presence. Really enjoyable."
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.55,"2022 vintage review from Untappd rating on Jan 29, 2022

This is a fantastic beer that I wish I got to share. Coffee - check, cinnamon - check. What more do you want or need?"
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,3.52,"Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb 2022 – from Fremont. Received from @snaotheus in a ninja strike during BSBIF#1. Reviewed 04/02/24 (Review 3240). Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Printed on the bottom of the front label of the bomber “LIMITED 2021 RELEASE”. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Served at 55.0 degrees F in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 60.2 degrees F.
Appearance – 4
First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), slight haze.
Body – Black (SRM 40), opaque. Under direct light, same with tiny carbonation bubbles rising. When rear-lite, light penetrates at the bottom edge – ruby – and the top edge, citron.
Head - Average (Maximum three cm, aggressive center pour), brown sugar, high density with a few rocks, fizzy, short retention, leaving a 0.2 crown and partial cap.
Lacing – None, as expected at 13.5% ABV.
Aroma – 3.25 – Chocolate and hints of bourbon. No yeast, no hops, no malt, no spices, no alcohol (13.5 % ABV as marked on the label).
Flavor – 3.5 – Begins bitter-sweet with chocolate and mild bourbon. No yeast, no hops, no roasted malt. On the aftertaste, weak coffee, and cinnamon. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. No ethanol. An uncomfortable gastric burn occurs.
Palate – 3.5 – Medium; somewhat syrupy; soft but lively carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 3.75 The label sets expectations high but the product fails to hit them. The flavor is that of cheap caffe mocha with a bit of cinnamon and whiskey thrown in to make it interesting. In general, unharmonious flavors are vying for attention. Aroma isn’t bad, nor is appearance (any time the appearance is the high point, expect problems). Overall, IMHO a missed target from a brewer that usually nails it."

Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.5,2017 version sampled in a short glass as a bar share at Ansaris. A wonderful blended treat.
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.96,"Stumbled upon this while gazing and kept coming back to it. Glad I finally decided to buy it. Great mouth feel, delicious taste that has the mentioned cinnamon and coffee with additional hints of berry (similar to açaí). Great beer overall!"
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.91,"I didn’t know if I’ve had this before, but tonight I went through my Fremonts and saw I had two, so....

A beer that lives up to the ratings and rankings.

2018 vintage, and if this has faded, I can only imagine how strong it is fresh.

Pours dark, frothy creamy head and persistent lacing. Strong scents of cinnamon, coffee, and bourbon barrel over dark malt. Taste is very strong flavors of cinnamon, coffee, dark fruit, cocoa, and bourbon barrel. Damn, does this taste good. Medium bodied, mouth watering, a very barrel forward presence.

This is just a goddamn great beer. Although I probably won’t let my second bottle get too much older, as this is in prime drinking time."
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.41,"Purchased on Tavour. Dark caramel color. Smell awakens the senses with coffee & cinnamon dominating. Taste follows, light bourbon an the back end. Feel is medium thickness. Overall, a wonderful strong ale."
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.2,"8 ounce pour - $10.00 at Woodstock Beer Market in Woodstock, Georgia.

Appearance: Presents a very dark brown-hued body with a slim, scant ring of beige foam.

Smell: Resounding, rich dark maltiness infused with cinnamon-vanilla infused sugar, (subtler) coffee, chocolate powder, German dark bread, dark syrup, dark fruits (all tings dark, really).

Taste: Sweetish dark maltiness of toasted black bread, rounded roasted barley, scorched raw sugars with a mellow-minded earthy, woodsy quality from the spice and barrel. A pleasant, agreeable spiciness, particularly with the cinnamon without venturing into heavy-handed crap-can Red Hot candy territory. Dark fruitiness a little raisiny. Touches of vanilla creme, Dutch stroop. Subtle coffee infusion. Good amount of barrel character, it's certainly warming though never heated or hot. Continued traces of fruit and spice on the silken finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Low carbonation. Smooth, supple mouthfeel.

Overall: Enjoyable."
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.39,"2022 vintage. Poured from a waxed 22oz bomber into a snifter.

Clear bistre kissed seal brown liquid topped by a lasting event-horizon of desert sand. Thick, fine lacing; shimmering sticky panes of tears; excellent retention.

Champurrado, cocoa, cinnamon, and earthy coffee with a hints of kretek in the nose. Very mild.

Intense palate entry, heavy/sharp sweetness with waves of blackstrap, coffee, walnuts, black currant, and fig. Moderate earthy bitterness washed away by the alcohol (hints of rum and irish whiskey, and port more than bourbon) and spice notes in the long medium finish. Low tartness with hints of oak comes and goes.

Rich, creamy, medium-full bodied, with low astringency and good round carbonation. A tiny bit hot perhaps.

An interesting base beer not overwhelmed by adjuncts, though quite coffee-forward at the moment."
The Broken Truck,4.43,"Bottled 12/23. The funkiest of the funkiest. Poured super foamy because I had the world’s most powerful Rabbit wine opener. But after a while head is a memory. Dark orange. Funky Brett scents and tastes. It’s interesting. Nice mild buzz burn, medium bodied, slightly muddy finish. Interesting and complex yet somehow simple."
The Broken Truck,4.43,"A few year back when I visited the brewery they had sold out of this long sought after ale just hours before. Woof. At least, my harpoon has struck this white whale! Murky orange body with a tight and full white bubble head, sporadic lacing clings to the glass. Smell features big peach and orange with various oaks, mild barnyard funk, yogurt, and pretty strong barrel funk. Taste is more oaky, add lemon to the fruits from the nose, funk is much more subdued, but still has the drying effect on the finish. Feel is really the star as it’s pretty stunning how artful dry effervescent this beer is with the oaks being shown off in an expressive yet balanced way."
The Broken Truck,4.06,"no5
Look - Orange slight slight slight haze with slight rimming, Nice for being 5 years old

Overall - hoping for more but still not bad"
The Broken Truck,4.42,"On tap at De Garde

A- pours bright and golden in color with a one finger foamy white head that has great retention

S- a floral bouquet up front with plenty of Brett notes; hay, barnyard, green apple, pear. Undertones of oak, lemon & yogurt

T- slightly tart and funky up front but remarkably drinkable. Fruity notes of green apple, lemon and ripe pear. Mid palate gives some funky barnyard notes with hay and just enough tartness. The finish gives more fruits with a Brett linger

M- medium body with moderate carbonation, foamy mouthfeel, semi dry finish"
The Broken Truck,4.29,"A: Cradled discharge to the carafe, which precedes the conveyed ounces to the stoneware without disturbing the residuals. This is a continuous draw to isolate the sediment, for resettling & repurposing thereafter. In this case, a concealed coloration to the ceramic, if not allowing an aerial perspective. Correspondingly, the isolated carafe is not clay built, and is more accepting to the environmental auras. This is shown through a shade near tiger lilies, while the later transfers decant with a tinged (sweet potato) hue. All the while, radiation impacts that aerial perspective on the isolated – porcelain – ounces, which has a California poppy tone, before decanting a late shade towards sun conures. There are cloudy inceptions that are relaxed over time, as longevity obstacles an interlaced lucidity. On the other hand, a white hibiscus collar tops at around/< .3 dm, which is shortly combatted through stunted PH levels, departed lupulin effects, and impacted ions. Accordingly, the retreat is advanced to thin seclusions, from a micro- to a nanometer level, of thickness. The output here has a dogwood flower tinge, which is eventually dispersed & canceled out. With this in mind, there is an insignificant preservation on fretwork, unless controlling the disturbance(s) upon the turns & discharges

S: An intricately involved webbing through the fermentable behaviors, while an oak ridden subtext materializes. The amylase conversions on alpha and beta are necessitated over time, as an incandescence exploitation develops over the clay pot lays, which softens the sheltered acidity to nuance the trails. Respectively, the kickoff is soft to pencil in phenylethyl acetates, which render fresh-cut peonies & agave nectars. Such aspects sit beneath isoamyl octanoates, when detailing peaches aside rangpurs with bergamot oranges on a higher floor. A voyage that draws in a resemblance to apple cobblers & apricot compotes at the midriff, while an oak lactone sentiment grows underneath. Appropriately, a wooded stave to plank presence with a rustic rurality in the forward climbs, just as Brettanomyces mount in volumes. This is conveyed through decanted intervals upon tepid breezes, as clocked degrees attend the aged corrosion(s) accordingly. To that extent, there is an isovaleric acid denotation to cultured cheeses, which has an elderly hop brink. Nonetheless, the main drivers place an emphasis on phenolic compounds, as time > 4 hrs. Markedly, sweaty hoofs amid goat-y pastures with a leathery – tannin – endowment, while grain silos billow smoke above an old broken truck

T: Polyhydroxy phenols are synthetically (& naturally) bound to the build, which provides an attenuated assist, upon the suspended timetables. A facet that stays below to not overdo, or outperform, as the intention is there to supplement the bacterial densities. The notations have a lactic ignition that eventually eases over time, providing a bready grain bill that speaks to towering silos. Sequentially, a development that finds a recording near raw cranberry honey, while connoting decayed positions across morello cherries, lemons, and citrus. There is a eugenol to hexanoate compartmentalization towards the wort complications, when implying cloves apart anise, which steers an infectious benefactor upon the lipids of oak. Suitably, a 4-EP specification on rabbity phenols, which have a catacomb audacity through pholcidaes. The process is enamored across the balmy increments @ an hour > 6, for an evaporated nuance that neighbors Grüner Veltliner, before reaching (cellar-controlled) Oloroso VORS @ an hour > 18. Accordingly, damp growths ratify grapefruit, while an oxidized nuttiness grows amid buckskin & nicotiana

M: A refermented element on cellared acerbity that provides a calm softness to the effusions, while the fermentable derivatives cleanly manipulate. A vintage that has regulated the presence on sulfur dioxides to gunpowder, beyond the presetting notions most akin to sea shells. Thus, an approach that has an attenuated calmness on the weathered cessations, when maintaining a smooth to caustic balance

O: An involved development that’s facilitated over basket suspension, where the later ounces are subjected to the retreated residues. Thereby, driving an indigenous difficulty to wild microorganisms, while being careful to not containment the overall build. Outside of this, the methodology comes with a vintaged maturity, for reimagining the ester offshoots"
The Broken Truck,4.47,"Pours golden with frothy soap off white head. Mustyness and wash rind cheese with a touch of apple flesh on the nose. The first thing that stands out is that this is soft - it doesn't have any commandeering characteristics that detract from the others. I get some apple, some arugula bitterness, with restrained acidity. Maybe some musty sour cherry too, kinda like what you get in a kriek but very much more subtle. This is an excellent excellent spon beer. One of the best beers of this variety I've had in some time."
The Broken Truck,4.63,"Man if I had to put potentially the best beers of 2022 against each other, it might be this and that Gueuze from New Glarus. Whooo boy, some good'uns. This is the '22 bottle.

Pours yellow out on the river. Summer winding down, let's finish it up. Hits some amazing funky sour spontaneous notes. And they said it couldn't be done on this side of the pond. Just a delight to smell. The best of what Tilamook has to offer. Boasts fresh french oak feels, bugs, grapefruit, lemon rind, bleu cheese, green apple yogurt. The gang's all here.

The taste was such a nice thing, great bottle on one of those awesome yet sad close to summer beers. Made it memorable. Its vibrant, fresh cut hay and oak alongside some citrus wedges like you just stomped some kids at youth soccer. One of the best expressions of brett ever in a beer. Sawft body too, never felt too acidic or sour. This is honestly better than most Belgian gueuzes. I realize given the demographics of beer nerds, they're going to keep fetishizing Western Europe, but I'll be more than happy to take any of these Wisconsin and Oregon gems off your hands."
The Broken Truck,4.29,"Opened up No. 6 (1/20), 7 (1/21), and 8 (1/22) together and tasted side-by-side.

All three boasted a beautiful golden yellow on the pour, with frothy, aromatic head that was slow to settle into the body of the beer.

No.6 brought notes of lemon zest, oak, and white grape must on a sweet, musty backbone. No. 7 came on sweeter, with more of a citrus candy quality and a bit less Brett character. The oak component had more of a ""freshly cut"" aroma to it, and preceded notes of bleu cheese that I didn't get on No.6. No.8 was probably the most distinctly unique; white wine like with 7, but more of a grapefruit-specific citrus quality and a deeper complexity of wet hay and an overall better balance of sweet & funky.

The palate on all three of these were led predominantly with drying tannin and bitter citrus peel. The oakiness was relatively similar amongst the three and bolstered the flavor influence from the yeast bill, however while No.8 showed its youth with the least amount of bitterness, 7 & 8 had comparable dryness and a more noticeable citrusy bitterness. No. 6 was also had the highest level of residual puckering tartness.

Light-bodied, dry, and lightly bitter mouthfeel to all three. As mentioned, varying levels of tartness / acid, but all very soft in their carbonation and smooth in the finish.

Overall, I'm honestly surprised with how similar each vintage of these beers was. Each had their own unique nuances, but when broken down you could find very similar characteristics on both the nose and the palate with both, characterizing a predominance of fresh oak, Brett, bitter citrus, drying tannin, and a noticeable albeit subtle funky/cheesy quality on the backbone. Definitely fun to have these all side-by-side."
The Broken Truck,4.5,"OG batch 1 Broken Truck.
Classic de Garde taste, similar in quality to all of the ""Bu"" beers that were bottled during the brewery's infancy.
It lacks the nuance of Trevor's newer offerings; minimal funk, lesser barrel treatment, aggressively sour.
Overall, a legendary beer whose story was greater than its contents."
Bourbon Paradise,3.08,"Black pour, great khaki head faded quickly. Boozy, vanilla aroma. Too sweet, almost undrinkable."
Bourbon Paradise,4.4,"L: Pours a rich, dark chocolate that is near-black in hue. Forms some light bubbles but no appreciable head. There are some faint traces of effervescence emanating around the edge of the snifter. Held to the light, this beer has an opaque black hue.

S: Plenty of bourbon barrel, oak, vanilla, and coconut. Hints of dark chocolate, burnt sugar, molasses, and caramel. Faint notes of char, espresso, and dark fruit.

T: Follows the nose with a strong opening of dark chocolate, brownie batter, bourbon barrel, and roasted malts. Hints of espresso. Dark fruit (raisins?) that meshes well with caramel, vanilla, and coconut. Oak and slight char are detectable towards the finish.

F: Medium- to full-bodied, biased towards full. Has a thick, chewy mouthfeel, yet it's also surprisingly smooth going down. Minimal carbonation.

O: Excellent dessert beer. The flavor profile is a classic, nothing novel or surprising but rather a very well crafted beer that hews to the classic AIS formula. Definitely worth a try."
Bourbon Paradise,4.27,"Pours a viscous black with a thin dark tan head that quickly dissipates. Pleasant vanilla and oaky notes. Rich vanilla flavor gives way to a subtler bourbon notes. Mouthfeel is very full and dense. Hardly any carbonation. Overall, a stellar BBA Imperial Stout!"
Bourbon Paradise,4.63,"Prairie is a bucket list breweries to visit. My hearing aid tech is from Oklahoma and in conversation I mentioned my bucket list. She said she was going home for the holidays and knowing she would have more choices of beers than I would ever see here in Florida she brought some brews back to me that I had on a list. This was at the top of my list and I can taste why!! Lots and lots going on in my mouth, all great, and as I swallow. Wonderful."
Bourbon Paradise,4.59,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter

A- pours jet black in color with a one-finger foamy khaki head that reduces to a ring

S- heavy barrel aromas on top with barrel juice, wet oak and caramel. Brownie batter, brown sugar, molasses, figs & mocha swirl follow. Undertones of vanilla bean and creamy coconut close it out, along with booze and more barrel

T- rich and malty up front with bold brownie batter, caramel, espresso, toffee and molasses. Mid-palate brings out a rich barrel note, adding bourbon and an enhancing note that brings out the vanilla addition. The finish gives more brownie batter and bold barrel notes, with a light creamy vanilla note popping through on the linger

M- medium-heavy body with moderate carbonation produces a slightly syrupy mouthfeel that turns into a velvety, slightly creamy warming finish

O_ world class BA stout"
Bourbon Paradise,4.55,2019 version poured from a 12oz bottle into a Dogfish Head snifter on 2/15/2022. Aged very well.
Bourbon Paradise,4.32,"1822
Name: Bourbon Paradise
Style: Barrel-Aged Imperial Stuff
Location: Kreb, Oklahoma
ABV: 13.7
Date: 2022

Continuing with stouts, I chose this from Prairie. Using my Jester tulip glass, I let the beer warm up to 56 degrees. A hard pour created a half finger, medium dark tan head. The retention is dismal, and dropped as fast as it formed. The color of the beer charts arounds SRM 36, dark brown with ruby hues. The beer is opaque but does show some carbonation bubbles on the sides of the glass. Overall the appearance is average for this style, I wanted to see a longer lasting head.

Nosing the beer, I detect dark chocolate, vanilla, coconut with espresso. After smelling the beer several more times, I notice caramel, bourbon, oak, hints of floral, dates, raisins, slight char, roasted malts, bready, and a touch of Maillard.

The chocolate weaves coconut with vanilla seamlessly. Other flavors in the beer are caramel, bready, roasted maltiness, raisins, figs, oak, bourbon, oak, anise, soy sauce, oranges, hints of floral, Maillard, and char.

The heavy roasted malts gives the beer a heavy body and a low carbonation. A chewy thick mouthfeel and a lasting finish.

The beer is tasty, yet I have a few complaints. I wanted more coconut flavors and less char. Overall the beer is a wonderful example of Imperial stout. I enjoyed sipping this one on a cold winter night."
Bourbon Paradise,4.77,As good as it gets
Bourbon Paradise,4.5,"On tap at Frisco Taphouse in Crofton, MD. Definitely lives up to expectations - pours pitch black with a tan head, huge aromas and flavors of dark roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, bourbon, vanilla, and some coconut. Rich and sumptuous mouthfeel. Stellar."
Bourbon Paradise,4.63,"It's incredibly rich and decadent....it's delicious....perhaps the thickest creamiest beer I've ever had... the bourbon is quite evident, as it should be... the coconut wafts in and out like a ghost....incredibly intense experience....having this on Black Friday morning while cooking a breakfast casserole... warming to the belly after a few healthy sips...this is a real banger.

The sort of beer you pull out for just the right moment.. I love it...one is enough due to its intensity and richness...

A masterpiece..."
Supplication,4.77,On tap. Pours a cloudy brown with white foam. Sour aroma. Medium body with a slick feel. Malty up front with a Pinot noir and sour cherry finish. Complex and delicious
Supplication,4.6,"Poured from a 375ml bottle dated 10-22-21 at 52 degrees into a teku glass.

Look- Amber brown, slight haze, medium dark tan sudsy head, below average head retention and lacing.

Smell- Pinot Noir, cherry, oak, brett, medium strength of scent.

Taste- Pinot Noir, cherry, oak, brett, moderately sour, mildly sweet, high strength of flavor.

Feel- Medium body, slightly above average carbonation, highly dry finish, mildly sweet, moderate acidity, moderately sour.

Overall- The appearance was amber brown as promised with below average head retention and lacing. The bouquet was a pleasant Pinot Noir, cherry, oak and brett. My only complaint with the nose was the strength. Flavors were a very nice blend of Pinot Noir, cherry, oak and brett. Feel was great with medium body, highly dry finish, moderate acidity and gentle abundant carbonation. Overall this was a highly complex beer that delivered a delightful drinking experience. Normally this is not a style that I tend to gravitate toward, but I will definitely drink this beer again if I see it."
Supplication,4.53,"August ‘23. A fresh bottle.
L: Ruby, reddish orange, thin head.
S: Rich cherry, vanilla, strawberry, hints of spices and oak, alcohol.
T: Tart joyful fruity spices. Tart cherry and apple upfront backed with cinnamon. Spices through the body, mainly cinnamon. Faint malty caramel. More sweetness in the body. Hints of berry. Notes of oak, mineral, and funk on the finish.
F: Tart, faintly prickly, dry finish.
O: Late summer, in a bottle. Fall and the harvest are faintly on the air. That’s what this is. The spice, the fruit, what a beer."
Supplication,4.49,"Supplication (2023) from Russian River. 12.68 fl oz cork and cage bottle from @2beerdogs in NBS BIF #17. Reviewed 23/06/23 (Review 3127). Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Label stamped “BOTTLED ON 020823”. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Served at 49.8 degrees F in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 55.9 degrees F.
Appearance – 4.25
First pour – Gold (SRM 5), clear.
Body – Deep Gold (SRM 6), chill haze. Under direct light, opaque. When rear lite, chill haze.
Head: Average (Maximum 3.5 cm, aggressive center pour), champagne, high density, quickly diminishing to a 0.5 mm broken ring of bubbles with no cap.
Lacing – None.
Aroma – 4.5 – Weak cherries and oak. No yeast, no hops. No ethanol (7.75 % ABV according to the label).
Flavor – 4.5 – Cherry, slightly sour with some tannin. No yeast, no hops. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. No ethanol flavor but pleasant gastric warming.
Palate – 4.5 – Medium; watery; lively but soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.5 Another excellent brew from RR. Their combo of pediococcus, lactobacillus, brettanomyces and saccharomyces species yields a great tasting mixture of organic acids and other metabolic end products although as the temperature rises, the tannin begins to dominate. Still, quite good!"
Supplication,3.73,"375mL cork-topped bottle, bottled on 020823 (barrel aged 9 to 15 months, pinor noir barrels, with cherries). Served in my new stemless CBC glass. Brillian ruby color with excellent clarity and little head formation. Mild aroma suggests a bit of tartness. Flavor brings on a LOT of that tartness, approaching outright sour, but has a delicious ripe cherry flavor which complements the Brett nicely. Sharp carbonation is suitable here.

If I was more into sours I might find this outstanding. I find it more drinkable than Cerise Cassée, and I really appreciate the balance here. Unfortunately for me it's a balance between sour Brett and sweet cherries, not so much the oak and the brown ale underneath that I'd be more interested in."
Supplication,4.44,"This pours out copper, a bit of haze, minimal head and no lacing. Nose is a punchy vinegar note, wine barrel and fruit beneath. Flavor is a less aggressive presentation of the nose, with cherry and full red wine elements melding into the strong acidity. The wildness also comes through as a counter to the acidity, putting some earthiness and funk on the back end. Well built and delicious."
Sip Of Sunshine,4.49,"I've had SoS many times, and in fact at this year's Vermont Brewers Festival I recognized Sean Lawson just from his caricature on each can. I was surprised to find I haven't rated it.

Pours a nice amber-gold in the glass, with just a touch of haze. Smell is piney citrus with some floral hints. That sounds like any of 100 IPAs, but SoS has a really inviting smell.
On the palate the first thing that hits is the bitterness and that lingers on the swallow, but between those points you get some malty sweetness and lots of fruit notes. It drinks like a regular IPA - the 8% doesn't show in the taste, only in adding a bit of body to the mouthfeel.

Vermont IPA (and DIPA) really deserve to be their own style(s). This has way more in common with Alchemist and Fiddlehead IPAs than the NEIPAs it's often lumped together with."
Sip Of Sunshine,4.62,Super dialed. Drink as cold as possible.
Sip Of Sunshine,4.75,"I’ve had Lawson’s Little Sip of Sunshine before, it’s good but wow this beer is incredibly smooth for a DIPA, dangerously smooth. You would never know it’s 8 ABV. Some bitterness, some fruitiness, very balanced. Definitely worth a try."
Sip Of Sunshine,4.23,"Hazy deep gold, minimal head..smells good, tastes absolutely fantastic! Maybe the best DIPA I’ve ever had. I don’t know why I haven’t purchased this one more often..That will change from now on. Cheers!"
Sip Of Sunshine,4.32,"Pours a brassy color, clear off white puffy head, ok retention.

Nose is so bright and vibrant; it’s like the can says, “tropical vacation,” but it’s clean and refreshing tropical; as if those tropical fruits had a pine like brightness, there is a little sweetness to it too.

Taste is a moderate dose of maltiness; the tropical notes are back but cut deeply by resin and pine like quality in the hops; the do not fight one another but balance one another out.

Medium in body, but definitely towards the higher end, biting and tingly bitterness on a quite clean finishing beer, there is a light warming from abv but the drinkability wins out; dangerously drinkable beer."
Sip Of Sunshine,4.35,"This beer certainly doesn't need my review as it's a modern classic with WC heritage more than anything. The beauty is in the perfect balance of feel, savory pine resin, coppery looks, and non conformist execution. The flagship in a fleet of solid brews for Lawson's Finest"
Sip Of Sunshine,4.76,This beer is my go to beer when i cannot get to the River Roost Brewery in White River Junction for their offerings. I like the smooth fresh taste and no after bitter.
Sip Of Sunshine,3.65,"Tastes like an IPA. Citrus, a little pine, slightly herbaceous, very bitter but still quite drinkable. Can't really complain, but, am I missing something? What exactly makes this the best stuff ever?"
Sip Of Sunshine,4.64,"A: At home, poured 1 pint can into chilled glass. Full inch of foam, head retension 2+ minutes. Medium amber with slight haze. Good inch of sparse thin lacing that stayed on glass sides.

S: Smell has some citra with lemon. Hop has a piney taste with some other citrus flavoris.

T: Awesome initial bitterness that meshes with the hops. Not too sweet and very enjoyable. Residual bitterness followed by slight warmth of alcohol. Malt had nothing indicated by smell. But the malt almost gave me a hint of honey with a medium body slightly sweet finish. Very mild which balanced well with the carbonation.

M: Medium body that was not to crisp allowing for a more full carbonation, hop, alcohol balance without being too heavy. Also not too sugary or creamy at all. What it should be. Very enjoyable. I wish I was in VT. No tartness or acidity present. Everything was well integrated.

O: This was a great option from the can. Enjoyed the flavor development as it warmed up in a glass. I would get this again and happy to have cans local."
Citra,4.5,"This is a very good IPA that rivals Russian River Brewery IPA's. Circulation is a challenge, most stores in Northern CA do not carry it, urgh."
Citra,4.51,"Pours an effervescent gold/honey with a thumb eggshell colored head. Good head retention & lacing

S: Bready, piney, lemons, mangoes. Pineapple shows up as this beer warms

T: Follows the nose, dryness, pineapple & grapefruit up front. Grapefruit, limes, a hint of pine & dryness/breadyness once this beer is warm. Finishes a touch cakey with pineapple, grapefruit & a kiss of green melon

MF: Medium body, moderate carbonation, nice balance

Classic West Coast DIPA, in your face, but very drinkable to the point of too easy. This would so be in my rotation if feasible"
Citra,4.42,"Pours a cloudy golden straw with a finger of foamy head that slowly dissipates to a thin ring with some lacing. Aroma of pineapple, mango, grapefruit and trace of pine. Taste follows nose."
Citra,4.6,"The first Citra was incredible. We found that bottle aging for ten days smoothed it out.
After a few years of substandard Citra hops resulting in a brew not as good as the first, it's back up to where it was in the beginning.
Since KRBC switched to all aluminum cans, the mouth feel is less wonderful than from a bottle.
It's best at the brewery.

I go to drink, not to eat. The waffle fries are flavored soggy cardboard.

Citra,4.46,"Citra from Kern River Brewing, 16 fl oz can from @2beerdogs in NBW BIF 17. Reviewed 25/04/23 (Review 3082). Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Lower rim of can stamped “CANNED ON 0?/2?/23”. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Served at 45.3 degrees F in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 54.5 degrees F.
Appearance – 4.25.
First pour – Pale Straw (SRM 2), clear.
Body – Pale Gold (SRM 4), hazy. Under direct light, same. When rear lite, translucent.
Head: Large (Maximum 4.5 cm, aggressive center pour), ivory, high density, average retention, rapidly retreating, leaving a 1.2 – 2.2 cm jagged crown and a rocky complete layer. As the head contracts, irregular elongated islands remain above the head.
Lacing – Good – remnants of the head following the patterns of the head, but thinner.
Aroma – 4.5 – Grapefruit and generic citrus (tending toward pineapple) backed by caramel malt, no yeast. No ethanol (8.5 % ABV as marked on the label) aroma.
Flavor – 4.5 – Follows the nose. Begins and ends citrusy and full-bodied, a bit dank and resinous over caramel malt. No yeast or ethanol. Barely noticeable gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Ends crisp and dry with a little resin.
Palate – 4.25 – Full; dry; lively carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.5 Good DIPA – dank, crisp, and citrusy."
Citra,4.68,"The smell is just unreal and this one is not for a first time IPA drinker. What a treat, and I hope they continue to expand with their distribution. Very lucky to get a hold of this legendary beer. So many powerful tasting notes, and the sweetness at the end is done just right."
Citra,4.72,"Pours golden yellow with thin white foamy cap in small tulip glass on draught at Father’s office. Beautiful citrus pineapple, mango and hops on the nose. Really great springy DIPA bursting with Citra hops! Cheers to greatness!"
Citra,4.51,"Citra pours a slightly hazy, cloudy amber color with a big beautiful head. A sixteen ounce, canned 11/24/22 is very strong with the Citra aroma. Taste is powerful and good. Citra and Amarillo go together well in this brew. Fabulously smooth and not really bitter at all. Overall a fine Double IPA."
Citra,4.35,"Both @2beerdogs and @Beersnake1 sent me cans of this one related to the recent NBS BIF#16, so I guess the California contingent feels strongly that I should try it!!

Beautiful clear caramel gold colour with a good finger plus of just off white foam. Soft and velvety with sprinkled large bubbles, it sticks to the glass as it recedes.

Nose is a great showcase for citra hops, and that works for me, because citra is a great hop! There's some citrus, some pine, some kind of light honeysuckle and wonderful rich complementary caramel malts underneath.

Flavour isn't quite as rich as the aroma, but it presents all the goodies. Bitter citrus and pine, some caramel malts, some round fruits... finish is bitter but not overpowering by any means. It's mostly in the pith/citrus side of things, but not the full on acid bomb of like a Monkish, and it's balanced with a little bit of earthy pine and a touch of the sweet malts to balance.

This is just a phenomenal beer all around, and right up my alley. I love what I've tried from Kern River, and I can see why both Tim and Derek both independently thought I should try this beer. Thanks, fellas!!"

4th Anniversary,4.43,"Growler from OH FLX 3 days ago.
Big straw/lemon gold hazy with 1/2 inch creamy white head. Dissolves pretty quickly with decent residual lacing. Somewhat subdued nose but a complex mash up of straw, grass, lemon, lime, dank integrating with grapefruit comes out as beer loses initial chill. Taste is more prominent grapefruit and dank though juicy melon, malty biscuit, citrus also show off. Body is a nicely smooth medium malty body accompanied by a refreshing bright carbonation. Considering 10% and content weight…surprisingly refreshing.
Overall a great heavyweight IPA.
Glad I could try it as “draft”."
4th Anniversary,4.35,"Canned on 12/25/2025, Picked up today 12/30/2023 at Rockefeller center after fighting the crowds to look at a tree

Straw yellow body with some a bit of warm yellow orange if the light hits it right. White frothy head with nice sticky lacing down the sides. Nose is dank and boozy - grass, grapefruit oil, dried mango. Taste is bitter and boozy up front and then moves to the fruity mango, with very warm booziness at the end. Warm pineapple juice type sweetness, hoppy, thick and slick from the booze, this is not an everyday beer - but I don't think it's trying to be. What it is, though, is delicious and bold."
4th Anniversary,4.52,2023 Anniversary Version - Really good IPA - nice hope mix - excellent balance - next to no booziness for 10% (as is OH's way) - creamy with plenty of citrus backing - very solid.

Consumed 12/26/22

I was surprised to see that Trillium did a Xmas drop in the Chicagoland area of fresh hazy beers, so I grabbed some as soon as I could for my holiday week. I find that when someone can do a lower abv (6.6%) with a lot of flavor that that is more an achievement than knocking out a DIPA. My pallet generally goes toward liking the higher abvs, but I need the lower one once in awhile when having more than one beer in a sitting. I am loving the balance in bitterness here more than anything. The Midwest brewers love to land on the sweeter side, but I actually like the dryer bitter finishes more. The beer does lack quite a bit on the nose as I am not getting much beyond some citrusy hop notes buried deep. The feel is full and smooth. Overall a great beer. I wish I had a fresh Zombie Dust to compare to see which would win for me."
Rocky Road - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.74,"Drank on tap at Angry Chair Brewing, Tampa, Florida
Served in a tulip

Dense, oily, near pitch black appearance. There was zero head and no lacing whatsoever.

The aroma was outstanding. Toasted marshmallow came through big time. Loads of fragrant vanilla as well. There was a nice milk chocolate presence too. Hint of graham cracker and kiss of boozy barrel. The barrel was a bit more subtle than I anticipated however. Quite sweet overall, though appropriately so given the style.

The flavor profile was nearly as impressive as the aroma and boozier. Again, marshmallow and vanilla came through super strong. Nice caramel and roasted malt base up front. Boozy bourbon notes appeared from the get go and intensified as the beer moved along the palate. Good dose of milk chocolate in the center. The beer was definitely sweet but not excessively so. More boozy bourbon barrel character on the back end and the finish. A pleasant alcohol warmth lingered after the swallow.

Excellent rich, full bodied mouthfeel. Perhaps a touch thinner than I anticipated however. Oily and slick on the palate. The liquid contained a fine, mellow effervescence that worked nicely for the style.

Bourbon Barrel-Aged Rocky Road literally smelled like liquefied, booze-soaked s’mores, and it tasted pretty similar as well. Angry Chair Brewing are known for producing some of the best pastry stouts in the world, and this one did not disappoint."
Rocky Road - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.0,"2022 vintage; consumed on 1/20/2024

Pours a viscous, midnight-black body capped with just shy of a finger of dark khaki-hued foam; decent head retention leaves a slight layer of cap, lasting, frothy collar, and no lacing holding to the walls of the glass with any longevity.

Aromas of gooey marshmallow waft into fruity rye spice as a walnut underscore embraces bourbon vanillins against a milk chocolate build and barrel char lingering.

Taste brings cocoa resounding upfront, with bourbon vanilla interludes meeting a peak of chocolate-covered walnuts through the mid-palate while barrel char and darker cocoa residuals mark the back end of the profile.

Mouthfeel shows a medium-full body and a lower froth of carbonation, yielding a thick, malted slickness over the mid-palate as a prickly warmth and wispy char cuts through a modest yet overarching stickiness into the back end.

Minimal barrel yet true-to-form, the Rocky Road inspiration comes through in spades; an honest mock dessert à la sweet stout in typical Angry Chair fashion: comfortingly one-dimensional."
Rocky Road - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.5,2022 version poured from a 750ml bottle into a plastic cup while camping outside Toppling Goliath for 2023 stout stock. I'd been chasing this one for a while and it did not disappoint. Creamy and medium thick.
Rocky Road - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.9,"#190, yummy!"
Leaner,4.25,Batch date 10/10/22; strong hit of acidic sour up front that transitions to a nice ripe juicy peach finish. Very delicious beer and glad I secured a bottle to try.
Leaner,4.69,"Just starting off by saying this beer is just stupid good, now that I have that out the way I'll continue with more detail. The pour of the beer isn't anything overly special, typical golden orange color, rapidly fading white head. The smell of the beer has that fruity Casey-like funk going on which is expected. The taste is honestly one of the best tasting peach sours I've had. I was truly blown away by the sweet yet tart peach flavor they were able to get out of this, incredible! The feel is medium bodied, finished dry and tart. Overall just outstanding!"
Triple Sunshine,4.76,"Pours an effervescent & hazed honey color with a thumb+ of cream colored head. Good head retention & lacing

S: Citrus, pine, sweet oranges once opened up

T: Follows the nose, pretty cakey, a little dry, a kiss of pineapple, a touch of pine as well up front. Sweet orange, grapefruit, dryness, cakey notes & pine as this beer warms up. Finishes dry with grapefruit, pine, pineapple & a little cakeyness

MF: Fairly chewy body, but enough carbonation to push this beast along, superb balance!

Formidable, but plenty drinkable; dangerous! Probably as good as take on the style as I can remember"
Triple Sunshine,4.64,"Amber orange body has a light to moderate haze; head is fluffy white and sticky enough to provide lacing streaks. Aromas of hop citrus - tangerine and grapefruit come with a side of pine needles. A moderate sweetness on the nose translates to the opening of the taste, giving the lightly toasted malt a raw honey edge. It doesn’t take long for the candied orange to turn pithy. There’s a ring grapefruit and passion fruit note to keep things from jumping off the bitter edge. But thankfully, there is a slow decent into herbal, piney, and slightly earthy bitterness."
Triple Sunshine,4.66,"On tap, pours a clear light copper. Smell of citrus and resin hits from a couple of feet away. Taste follows, with a big resinous flavor that is surprisingly light and drinkable, especially at the ABV. Fantastic beer."
Triple Sunshine,4.91,"12 oz. can - canned on 1/03/23
Look - deep gold, luscious bubbly white head, good lacing left behind
Smell - tropical, dank, herbal, floral
Taste - spicy, dank hops, ripe pineapple, grapefruit pith
Feel - medium in body and carbonation, hoppy resinous sticky finish
Overall - Finally got hold of this gem on a beer haul from Vermont and it's just as great as I thought it would be. Like Sip and Double, the smell really pops right from the can and continues after the pour. No trouble picking up the dank tropical and herbal scent. Triple kicks off with spicy dank hops followed by ripe pineapple and grapefruit pith that ends with that wonderful resinous sticky finish. This is a bold brew that lives up to the hype so there is no other choice than to pair it with Sunshine of Your Love by Cream. I’ve been waiting so long, To be where I’m going, In the sunshine of your love!"
Triple Sunshine,4.49,"Draft at brewery. Golden pour, soft white head. Light fruity aroma with a hit of strength. Taste is sweet, fruity and warm. Smooth as a baby's bottom. Light toffee notes, orange. Another wow!"
Adios Ghost,4.69,"3/27/24 Batch! Sweet tropical hoppy, slightly malty, and an orange juicy, citrus-dank nose on this one! Taste follows with a soft and creamy, orange juice citrus hoppy bitter finish. Wonderfully balanced and hides the big ABV really well! As it warms, however, a gin-like, citrus booziness starts to peek out just a touch. Outstanding!"
Adios Ghost,4.82,So smooth for the ABV.
Sunday Brunch,3.93,"Drank from a 500 ml/1 pint .9 fl oz bottle purchased at Kane Brewing Company, Ocean, NJ
2023 Release Year

The beer poured a thinner bodied, dark chestnut brown hue that approached black. An inch-tall, foamy, tan colored crown topped the liquid and slowly fell to a thick, frothy cap and a dense, bubbly collar. Spotty lacing blanketed the glass after every sip.

The aroma was solid but not remarkable. Coffee notes came through strongest. Dark roast coffee specifically. Roasted malts were also apparent. Loads of cinnamon too. There was a subtle, sweet maple-like quality as well. Hint of vanilla. The maple intensified as the beer warmed.

The flavor profile was also very roast forward. Roasted malts led things off up front. Dark roast coffee was also quite apparent. Sweet maple notes came through in the center. Cinnamon was noticeable here as well. More deep roast on the back end and in the finish. Some bitter char lingered after the swallow.

The mouthfeel was super creamy and frothy but quite thin. The liquid contained an ultra fine, zippy, tongue blanketing effervescence that gave the beer a nice suppleness on the palate.

Five years ago, I might have really enjoyed this beer, but my current palate found it far too roasty and bitter for my liking. Additionally, as much as I tried to appreciate it for being an imperial porter, I could not get past wanting it to be a full-bodied imperial stout."
Sunday Brunch,4.76,Phenomenal. I need to get more.
Sunday Brunch,4.5,12/8/15
Sunday Brunch,4.59,"Appearance: Sunday Brunch pours a deep, dark brown color with a thick, creamy head that dissipates slowly.

Aroma: The aroma is rich and complex, with strong notes of coffee, dark chocolate, and a hint of vanilla. There are also hints of toasted oak and a slight smokiness.

Taste: The flavor is bold and intense, with a strong coffee profile and a noticeable alcohol warmth. The dark chocolate and vanilla flavors are present as well, with a slight sweetness that balances the bitterness from the coffee. There is a slight smokiness in the aftertaste that lingers on the palate.

Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is silky smooth, with a creamy texture that coats the tongue. The beer is medium-bodied and has a medium carbonation level, making it easy to drink.

Overall Impressions: Kane Brewing Sunday Brunch is a complex and flavorful beer that is perfect for sipping on a lazy Sunday morning. The coffee, chocolate, and vanilla flavors combine perfectly to create a decadent and satisfying experience. The alcohol warmth is noticeable but not overpowering, making it a great choice for those who enjoy a bit of a kick with their morning coffee. The smoky finish is a nice touch, adding an unexpected depth to the flavor profile. Overall, this is a top-notch imperial porter that is well worth trying."
Sunday Brunch,4.71,"Deep, dark black. Head was not as dark as I guessed it would be, more of an off white color. Strangely the nose is cinnamon at first, but after first taste then the nose was more coffee. Taste was cinnamon coffee with a smooth finish. Not bitter, all smooth!! Great Porter."
Sunday Brunch,3.69,"2022-02-06
500ml bottle served in a footed pilsner glass. 2021 vintage. Received from the glorious @jonphisher.

Pours very dark brown with a small head that fades slowly to an almost invisible skin and a small ring around the glass. Smell is chocolate and cinnamon.

Taste is cinnamon first, and all else second. Milk chocolate is definitely there. Some coffee bitterness. Might be a hint of syrupy sweetness.

Mouthfeel is medium tending toward thick. Overall, this is a good beer, but too much cinnamon for me. But, I'm a little oversensitive to cinnamon in beer."

Oh man, we have quite the big boy here. A 21% on a Tuesday afternoon? What the hell am I doing? Well, I’m on vacation this week and today turned out to be a stormy day, so I figured it’s the perfect time to crack this beer I received in a BIF from the legendary @Eziel. I’m getting close to the end of what he sent me, and they’re all heavy hitters. Let’s see what this one is all about

Pours a very dark brown with a finger of light beige head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

There’s a definite sweetness in the nose, but it’s wonderfully balanced given its size. I’m picking up on aromas of chocolate fudge, earthy bourbon, toasted oak, nougat, black cherry, sweet caramel, molasses, toasted hazelnut, and light vanilla

This one really packs a punch in taste, heavy booze and char fight for attention while a huge sweetness backs it all up. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting charred oak, cacao, sweet bourbon, red grape, marshmallow, sweet vanilla, molasses, toffee, light nutty malt, and black cherry. The swallow brings notes of hot bourbon, charred oak, nougat, cacao, black cherry, molasses, apple brandy, vanilla, sweet caramel, and nougat

A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a silky and slightly thick beer. Finishes mostly dry but boozy as all hell

There’s no 2 ways about it; this beer is incredible. So complex and hitting all the right notes. Perfect for a quiet day to myself hanging out outside while it rains"
Black Tuesday - Reserve,4.22,"2021 batch. Most of the BT Reserve years is two sets of bourbon barrels, but this one is grape brandy and then bourbon.

This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and no lacing.

This smells like charred oak, lots of bourbon, lots of vinous grape character, brandy, roasted malt, dark fruit.

This is a nice bridge between some of overtly wine based Black Tuesday variants, and the regular bourbon Black Tuesday. The grape brandy adds a pleasantly oaky vinous character, sweet, but finishes dry, with oaky char, marshmallow, dark chocolate, caramel, roast, and bourbon.

This is medium bodied, slightly thin as most Black Tuesday variants tend to be, with a lots of concentrated booziness. It’s not overwhelmingly boozy, but it really kind of does drink like a distilled stout liqueur.

I haven’t had much Bruery in a while, but this was definitely a fun beer to revisit this brewery with. It’s definitely something to share with a bunch of people, like 10 people, maybe, but it’s well done."
Black Tuesday - Reserve,4.56,"750 ml wax capped bottle, 2021 edition (aged in Copper & Kings grape brandy barrels for a year, then aged an additional year in bourbon barrels), 21.8% ABV, bottled 01/19/21. Served in a Black Tuesday chalice, the beer pours dark brown/black with not quite an inch tan head that fizzled away somewhat quickly. I like the aroma a lot, the brew smells like dark fruit, brandy, bourbon, vanilla, molasses, dark chocolate and roasted malt. I like the taste a lot too, it's similar to the aroma but with the addition of some dark bread, burnt/charred malt, coffee, licorice and earthy flavors. There's a lot going on here, but all of the flavors mesh well together with no one flavor overpowering the others. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's coating and a bit syrupy with a moderate amount of carbonation. Nowhere near as boozy as I was expecting considering how strong this brew is! Certainly worth trying if you get the chance to!"
The Peach,4.31,"12/23 bottle: label removes mention of cognac and adds that it was aged for 2 years. ABV listed as 6%.
Opens with a nice pop.
L: Three finger head that quickly condenses. Hazy, golden body.
S: Perfumey, funky peaches. The peach is the predominant aroma, but it sits behind a wall of slightly sour funkiness, hints of sea salt, and minerals.
T: Oh so bright. A dash of mellow creamy fruit upfront is quickly overpowered by tart citrus and peach. Lemon zest, lime, oak, hints of mineral and berry, and of course peaches. A few pleasant floral, grassy notes finish things off, along with a slightly creamy, mineral aftertaste.
F: Zippy, acidic, dry finish.
O: It gets better with each sip. The body tickles the tongue but the finish is gentle and drawn out and really invites another sip."
The Peach,4.52,"Backlog from Untappd. Tart, ripe fleshy peach. From May 2021."
The Peach,4.34,"Never giving up on those childhood snacks de Garde takes the influence of fruit rollup and rolls it into a winey, earthy, tart and spicy wild ale. With lambic influences at the helm at well, this fruit rollup is corked, capped and ready for adulthood.

Pale gold and lightly of chrome, the light and yeasty haze of The Peach teems with bubbles while building a loose necklace of foam. Pulling from its white wine appearance, the session kicks of with a plume of stone fruit over a citrusy, tangy, earthy, briney perfume chocked full of both funk and fauna. As its mild mannered sweetness greets the tongue, the suggestions of communion wafer, sourdough and a hint of tafffy gives a soft and wheaten buffer to start.

As the malt sweetness bounces effortlessly from the palate, the tastebuds soon carry the brunt of acidity that pangs away with lemon, lime, white grape, crabapple, yuzu and passionfruit with a stronger acidic twinge. All the while, the peach character gives a melon-like roundness for a smooth stone fruit taste. Nearly apricot, mango and orange-like, the bright and ripe peach flavor is radiant. Trending peppery with dry oak and lightly bittered hops, hints of grapefruit, grape seed and a mossy earthiness provide an earthy and peppery exit from the palate.

Light, crisp and highly refreshing, the off-clean ale finishes briskly acidic with a series of short sourdough echoes laced with peppery white wine, saddle leather and oak tannin."
The Peach,4.0,"2022-12-25
750ml capped/corked bottle served in a pair of little Cantillon stemmed glasses. Bottled 10/21.

Pours clear, light golden, with a small ghost of a head that disappears and leaves a tiny ring around the glass. Smell is tart and funky. A bit of wood, some dry chardonnay. Something musty. Very interesting.

Taste is dry, tart, very chardonnay buttery, peach / stonefruit notes are there but kind of drowned out by the woody / chardonnay notes. Tartness is somewhere between unripe peaches and lemons. Mustiness is some combination of the butter and wood notes I think.

Mouthfeel is medium to light, super dry, slight filminess, gives a sense of liveliness that might just be prickly acidity. Overall, it's good and very interesting."
The Peach,4.37,"Cloudy yellowy orange body, white cap settles into a collar quickly. Big peach nose, big barnyard funk, lesser so horse blanket funk, oak more than the cognac support but both there, slight floral notes too. Tart and somewhat earthy peach starts the taste before the dry and sharp funk massages the oak and light cognac into the peach, apricot, lemon, green apple all support, but finish doesn't elevate, rather it goes somewhat acidic with a hint of balsamic vinegar. Feel is bright, sour, decently acidic cumulatively, and funky, almost feel more vinous on the finish. Very nice peach wild ale. The 6th best? No, but still great on a cool summer afternoon on the porch"
Mexican Brunch,4.55,"Pours jet black like coffee without creamer. Little to no carbonation. Thin in appearance and feel. The smell is noticeable as soon as cracking the bottle. The taste follows the smell, sweet cinnamon and coffee dominate with subtle hints of chocolate. Maple is faint but adds a nice sweetness. Chiles almost non existent but that’s fine by me. Really enjoyable after dinner drink."
Mexican Brunch,4.24,"Taking brunch south of the boarder, Kane Brewing looks to chili peppers, cinnamon and cocoa to give a decidedly Mexican twist to their imperial milk porter.

Mexican Brunch kicks off with a very dark brown pour and a frothy cap that fades rather quickly. As a scent of coffee rises first, a quick followup of syrup, chocolate, nuttiness and spice ensure a complex and enticing scent. Fully malted and sweet on the tongue, high impressions of chocolate, caramel, maple, toffee and vanilla play out in hot chocolate fashion in its early impressions.

As the flavors start to unfold, the middle palate holds onto its milky sweetness while the strong taste of coffee sets an earthy, nutty and roasty tone. Cinnamon and chilies mingle next for a sense of balance for the sweetness and to complement the coffee spice. Woodsy, earthy and toasty, the beer trails into a kahlua-like finish with balance and contrast in taste.

Full bodied and soothing on the finish, the beer finishes both spicy and calmly with the milk sugars and maple rounding out the gradual simmer of peppers into a warming afterglow of a Mexican inspired, alcoholic cappuccino."
Mexican Brunch,4.57,"500 ml bottle poured into a teku

A- Black with a two finger mocha head.

S- Chocolate, cinnamon, some maple, coffee, some chili pepper, very well balanced.

T- Chocolate/fudge, coffee, maple syrup, some peppers, cinnamon, slightly earthy.

M- Smooth, creamy, full body.

O- A very well done and balanced molé stout. Easy to drink and a nice kick from the pepper even though it is on the more mild side."
Black Note Stout,5.0,Pours jet black with a thick dark caramel head on top. Smells very sweet with dark fruit and notes of barrel. Boozy but not too boozy well balanced. Got the sweetness along with toasted coffee.
Black Note Stout,4.44,"I’ve actually had this on tap a few times and sent it out on BIFs and trades but never sat down with a bottle to concentrate on the beer.
Until now.
Pour is stout black with a 1 cm light brown head which left rings of lacing.
The important part: the taste.
It’s not like either of the stouts that make up the blend, or maybe cuvée.
It’s a touch more coffee forward than Double Cream Stout and much less roasty than Expedition stout.
It *is* amazingly tasty with smooth coffee and chocolate and daaaark fruits.
This is way too easy to drink considering the ABV, I had the 12 ounces consumed in very short order.
Good beer!"
Black Note Stout,4.58,"12oz bottle, poured into a snifter glass. Packaged 10/31/2023, PRN 42801. 11.4% ABV for the 2023 bottling.

Appearance: Pitch black letting no light through, thin tan head with plenty of islands and fine strands of lacing.

Smell: Bourbon, vanilla, roasted malt.

Taste: Tasted a lot like it smells, but with a bit more vanilla and malt sweetness. Some definite dark chocolate and milk chocolate notes. Some espresso-like coffee bitterness, but there is more bourbon at the finish that tempers it. Not getting any dried fruit flavors as per the label, but still quite tasty.

Mouthfeel: Very smooth and creamy thick with just right carbonation.

Overall / Drinkability: Dangerously drinkable. Very smooth, well balanced between all the flavors, and the alcohol is well hidden. A nice sipping beer and this would go great with a dessert. Definitely something to look for again."
Black Note Stout,4.54,"Sampling a 12 oz bottle at cellar temp. Figured I do an expected great beer for my 3000th Review!!
Lets go.
Pouring the beer into my trusty snifter. The beer was bottled on 10/31/2023, received in a BIF this month.
Pours into my glass a solid black coffee color with a dense creamy tan head of .5 cm. the foam fades to a sturdy surface covering that remains through the sampling. i get some nice tight lattice when I swirl the glass or take a sip.
Aroma is roasted malt, dark chocolate, some black licorice or anice note, bourbon notes and hints of black pepper. No hop character on the aroma and not fusol, but I believe the black pepper note is booze hint.
First sip reveals a fairly thick body with smooth texture and full mouthfeel. Fine and tingly carbonation. Nice physical traits.
Flavor is similar to the nose with high cacao dark chocolate, some black licorice, and finishes with some slightly sweet bourbon. Again no hop character on this beer. There isnt really a lot of boozy warmth on the finish here either.
Pretty straight forward solid barrels aged stout, good complexity and blend of flavors. Very happy to have checked this beer and enjoying this tasty stout. The hidden ABV could be dangerous. Well worth seeking out."
Black Note Stout,4.67,"12 oz bottle fill date 10/31/23 into a snifter.
L: SRM 40 Pours jet black with a thin dark khaki head that quickly recedes to edge foam, low carbonation, no lacing.
S: Bourbon barrel notes, chocolate, darkly roasted cereal grains, caramel.
T: Mingling dark fruits, complex char, chocolate, dark berries, bourbon, wood barrel notes, dark caramelized malts, a bit nutty from the oaken barrels, finish is malty with espresso, bourbon, and sweet dark cocoa.
F: Smooth & resilient heavy-bodied feel with a long finish that is fairly drying.
O: Simply one of the finest BBA stouts I've had. Does not taste fake or adjunct-ridden as do many others. Smooth, rich, deep, long finish. Exceptional. Unlimited shelf life is touted but I'll get to the other 3 bottles this year. Good price point. This beer is absolutely world-class in its style."
Black Note Stout,4.5,"12oz bottled 10/31/23 (3+ months ago) poured into a tulip glass at fridge temp 11.4% ABV. The beer pours impenetrable black with medium brown colored head. The head recedes to a thin ring and island. Spotty lacing. The aroma is moderate in strength with bourbon soaked fudge brownie and lesser notes of ash and oak. The taste is bittersweet roasted malt with more bourbon, fudge brownie, oak and classic, ashy roasted malt character. The feel is medium plus bodied with just less that average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Overall, world class BBA imperial stout."
Black Note Stout,4.66,"Terrific stout! This is everything a barrel aged stout should be.

Dark chocolate, espresso, and plum flavors jump out the most. Brown sugar lingers on the finish. The mouthfeel is wonderful as well. If you see it, buy it!"
Black Note Stout,4.49,"L-Dark brown/black...no head...

S-Soy sauce like maltiness....rich....

T-Starts off with that Expedition rich, soy sauce like maltiness....then a tremendous touch of nougat, vanilla and very light bourbon....next a mild impression of dark fruits...plums, raisins....this is really excellent...very light touch of coffee deeper in....dark chocolate as well....

F-Creamy...big but smooth...no heat from the ABV....not cloying....easy to drink...a rare beast with immense flavors but a drinkability that could lead to more than one if compelled.

O-Love the taste of this and the way it drinks....sometimes with this style I'll really enjoy a particular offering but then have no craving to have it again to to the richness...that's not the case here despite it being plenty rich....aroma is a bit bland and one sided with the soy sauce maltiness..."
Black Note Stout,4.12,"Appearance: Pours a completely black, dark color with a massive and deep, rich, dark tan head. SRM of 24. (4.25)

Aroma: Strong aromas of bittersweet chocolate, cream, cocoa upfront. Some hints of coffee roast and more cream in the middle. Mild bourbon underneath. (4.00)

Flavor: Strong flavors of rich chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, cocoa, and cream upfront. Strong creamy chocolate notes linger before it evolves into a lactose and vanilla flavor. Some bourbon starts to balance, but ultimately the sweet chocolate cream overpowers and it finishes sweet and smooth. (4.25)

Feel: Heavier-bodied, average to low carbonation. Sweet, malty, creaminess linger. (4.00)

Overall: Rated 100 World-Class on BeerAdvocate and ranked #33 for American Imperial Stout. Supposedly similar to their Expedition Stout, but aged in Bourbon Barrels. Upfront drinks very much like their Expedition Stout. A beer battle between the two would be far too dangerous. Dark, chocolate, creamy, and sweet. Some hints of bourbon and minimal roastedness. The bourbon is relatively hidden within the sweetness. This one leans sweeter and rich in typical Bells fashion. I wouldn't drink this often. A sipper and almost an occasional or dessert beer I'd say. (Rating: 4.12)"
Black Note Stout,4.35,"Appearance: Black, ok head at first, fades to nothing.

Smell: Strong roast and char, molasses. Surprisingly little barrel.

Taste: Dark chocolate, roasted malt, a little cherry alcohol hit, a splash of black coffee. Lots going on but the flavors are working together. As it warms up, the barrel starts showing up with some woody vanilla. Medium-heavy mouthfeel. More chocolate in the finish as it warms.

Overall: Finally getting to try Black Note, total wine had a shelf full. Very nice BA stout. I've been a little hit-or-miss with Bell's big stouts, sometimes they are not quite sweet enough for my palate, but this beer hits the spot. Very Good!"
Black Tuesday,4.25,2017 version poured from a 750ml bottle into a Dogfish Head snifter. The booze in flavor tames down when you let one of these get some age on them. Solid.
Black Tuesday,4.63,"Deep dark mahogany with a large meniscus. Head dissipates immediately.

Aroma
Dark chocolate, bourbon barrel, booze and brown sugar.

Taste
Dark chocolate, dark caramel, brown sugar, bourbon. Medium sweetness. No hop flavor or bitterness. Boozy. Interestingly low body for such a big beer.

Well done!"

Black Tuesday,4.42,"2016 vintage - bottle to snifter; pitch black pour, light on head. Dark chocolate and bourbon notes. Great viscosity. Overall, a fantastic stout. Can't believe this was 20.3%. Did not drink as such."
Black Tuesday,4.48,"**
04/06/24

2023 Bottle to snifter.

**"
Black Tuesday,4.4,"Pitch black. Bubbly, soapy head upon pouring. Poor retention, but surprisingly a thin ring does remain.

Smelled booze as soon as I cracked the bottle. Straight up bourbon. A closer sniff reveals tons of bourbon as expected, butterscotch, toasted oak, caramel, vanilla, very sweet and rich dark chocolate, toasted marshmallow, tobacco, prune, milk chocolate, and black licorice.

It's still fairly cold--only been out of the fridge about 10 minutes--but the dark chocolate, molasses, toast, and caramel hit you upfront. Taste is surprisingly and dangerously smooth. Surprisingly, it doesn't lean heavily on cloy of dark chocolate/caramel/vanilla, though there is that. It actually leans fruity; candied plum, black cherry, and fig. Charred oak tannins contribute nudges of red wine. Tobacco, leather, and smoke on the mid-palate. Heavy char; black coffee and burnt toast. Bourbon warmth takes over, zinging and drying out the palate. Heavy astringency. The sweetness hits you on the finish--slick, oily, syrupy--but the booze and heavy tannins keep it in check. The finish lingers with chocolate, coffee, fruit leather, bourbon, and smoke.

Feel is lighter than expected but still heavy. Oily, slick, greasy, sugary. Medium to medium carbonation; it moves rather quickly on the palate. Mouthfeel is more like a carbonated brandy or port than your typically milkshake-like imperial stout.

How do I feel about this beer overall? It's hard to give an honest opinion, because everyone is so biased about it that it affects our collective judgment. It's very good and mold-breaking, but maybe not 100. I prefer the thicker feel and chocolate-coffee forward taste of other imperial stouts that are lower-abv. (Because I'm getting old lol)
Definitely don't regret buying/trying it, but I don't think I will again unless I share it with several other people."
Black Tuesday,4.95,"Black Tuesday pours black with a small, long-lasting tan head. The aroma is sweet figs and bourbon. The flavor is big, bold, and hot but it blends in with all the dark chocolate notes and sweet bourbon notes. Good, thick body. Overall, just about a perfect stout. Huge flavors, and completely hides the 19.5 abv."
Black Tuesday,4.5,"On tap into an 8 oz snifter, pours pitch black, as per the name. Smell and taste feature a complex blend of raisins, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, oak and bourbon. The alcohol warms going down, but is very well hidden. Not overly thick or sweet. Outstanding beer."
Nillerzzzzz,4.45,"Pitch black viscous body with a brown cap. Smells is luxurious: full vanilla backed by rye whiskey, bourbon, molasses, semi-sweet chocolate, marshmallow and caramel in that order of strength. Taste is very sweet, vanilla and marshmallow push the barrels to the limit, leaving the boozy parts to shine with a sweetened chocolate fudge. Feel is heavy yet not as thick as it looks, very smooth with warmth emerging from the cool vanilla stout base"
Nillerzzzzz,4.72,"On tap at the brewery into a tulip
A: Deep dark brown with a thin light brown head
S: Marshmallow, cocoa, hints of bourbon, vanilla and graham cracker
T: The cocoa comes through first with everything else after, bitter on the finish
F: Full-bodied, a bit sweet and bitter, only mildly boozy
O: Fantastic. Super complex, a small sip goes a long way and lasts a long time on the palate"
Nillerzzzzz,4.9,"#194, yummy!"
Nillerzzzzz,4.44,"Look - black and thick with a fantastic tan rimming and lacing
Smell and taste - so much barrel, booze, chocolate and vanilla... in that order
Feel - Thick and Creamy with a light carb
Overall - pretty fantastic for being from 2018 and drinking in 2023"
Keene Idea,4.37,"Old school piney crisp westie. Just a style that isn't brewed enough these days, and it's a real shame. Kick you in the teeth bitter - pours a delicious golden amber, and perfectly carbed. Very sippable. Not sure it lives up to the god-like status some hold it in, but it's a very solid west coast IPA."
Keene Idea,4.44,"Not sure why people feel the need to write reviews along the lines of ""it's an old style not fit for today's trends"".......it was brewed to be a piney, bitter, and malty beer and it's damn well crafted. If you were into trendy scotch drinks and were handed a glass of Louis XIII Cognac, would you poo-poo it for being different? Old school west coast IPA's exist for a reason, and they have certain qualities that make them different from the trendier new england style. This beer is a fantastic brew, with pine and malt flavors bursting onto the scene in a way you just don't find with most beers made elsewhere. When you take a sip, you just know it is a well crafted, and balanced brew."
Keene Idea,3.75,"No. No, no, no. I can't understand how everyone takes this well-balanced yet boring double IPA and elevates it to a godly status. It's fine, but the flavors, scent, and mouthfeel stop there. As a California born dude, I above all want to champion our beers. This is fine, but it's just not the champ."
Keene Idea,4.28,"Many reviews talk about the perfect balance between malt and hops displayed by this beer. They're not wrong. This beer has seen the tightrope strung across the canyon of drinkability and confidently trod the cord, using malt and hops as its balance beam while declining to use any of the 2020s' juiciness for a safety net.

Make no mistake, this is a bitter beer. It demands an experienced drinker's palate, but rewards the garnered experience of a craft beer drinker with a beer that displays subtle citrus notes, a strong yet not overbearing malt backbone and a hoppy, piney, resinous kick that unashamedly proclaims its double IPA genes.

In reality, this is an anachronism in 2022. It recalls the IBU wars of 15 years ago, but remains relevant because, at the end of the day, it's a damn good beer

Cheers!"
Keene Idea,4.78,"Pours golden in color with a nice head that leaves a beautiful lacing. The nose is slightly sweet, almost honey like hint but a bitterness added. Taste is bitter that quickly goes away with a dry finish. Superb beer."
Keene Idea,4.02,"Nearly clear amber brew with plenty of foam in the fat wheat beer glass. Lush with creamy carbonation. Malty and medium sweet. Aromatic with citrus and papaya. Taste is candied bitter orange, or marmalade. Very sippable and well made.

Hops are listed at Citra, Southern Cross, Nelson, and Pacific Jade. This DIPA bears the extra alcohol and malt well. A little of a hop overdose as you might expect. I have not had an Alpine beer in years so was happy to try one I had not seen. Brewed in San Diego. From the 16 oz can dated 10/25/21."
Beatification,4.53,Draught
Beatification,4.49,"375mL bottle (packaged 12/29/2022) into a tulip. Pours a clear golden color with a 1-finger white head that dissipates quickly.

Aroma is bright, tart, funky, grassy. Sour fruit, damp hay—in a good way. Enticing.

Taste is likewise clean, crisp, not quite puckering sour. Refreshing. Pale biscuity malt, green apple, Rainier cherry, sourdough bread, dry oak.

Mouthfeel is light and dry, vanishes off the palate. Highly drinkable.

Overall an outstanding beer and pretty much exactly what I expected from a Russian Rive sour/wild ale. Exquisite."

Beatification,4.18,"Poured from a 375ml bottle dated 1-25-22 at 51 degrees into a teku glass.

Look- Pale gold, very mildly hazy, plentiful small visible particulate, minuscule white sudsy head, nonexistent head retention and lacing.

Smell- Oak, funk, chardonnay, between weak and medium strength of scent.

Taste- Oak, funk, chardonnay, grapefruit, lemon, highly sour especially at the finish, medium strength of flavor.

Feel- Between thin and medium body, below average carbonation, highly dry finish, highly sour, moderately acidic.

Overall- Appearance was as expected with the exception of nonexistent head retention or lacing. Bouquet was good, but much weaker than expected. Flavors were good, but the sourness was slightly to much for my palate. The body was between thin and medium, but the carbonation was very noticeable low. Overall this beer provided an enjoyable experience, but did not live up to expectations. I’m interested in having it again in the future so I can judge if this bottle was slightly off."
Beatification,2.85,"Long, long time want of mine that I finally snagged in a beer store in Bend, Oregon during a recent trip. Bottled just about two years ago, which isn't too long in wild ale years, but I was surprised to find that whatever intended refermentation in the bottle didn't really seem to have worked out. The beer poured almost still with a distinct pee color. Barnyard-forward funky aromas -- hay, horse, must, herbal hop, and a bit of apricot. Taste has a good amount of that crushed aspirin bitterness alongside lemon, wheat, grapefruit juice, wildflower honey, and chardonnay grapes. Pleasant but fairly boilerplate spontaneous ale. Feel is not great due to the fermentation issues -- only the lightest of discernible effervescence. Overall a bit of a let down, but maybe it's just a bad bottle

< 60/100"
Beatification,4.4,"Look – Pours a nice clear golden color with a nice head and good lacing that quickly disappears.

Smell – Has a funky smell with citrus and oak. I found it quite nice.

Taste – Sour grapefruit, brett, barnyard funk, oak, and chardonnay.

Feel – Light, crisp, nicely carbonated, a bit sour.

Overall – This is a well above average sour beer."
Alter Ego,4.44,"Look - really nice thick hazy tannish yellow with a big thick lasting sticky white head
Smell - lots of juicy citrus tropical scents. It would.get a higher rating if the smell jumped out at you but it's just there
Taste - juicy mostly citrus slight tropical with a caramel malt backbone. Slight bitter bite. As it warms up more complex flavors come.out like berries.
Feel a little dry with a medium full body and a medium light carb
Overall - really fantastic"

Alter Ego,4.9,"#179, yum!"
Alter Ego,4.46,"Feeling a bit spoiled after sampling a good variety of TH past couple weeks. This is a solid, delicious NEIPA all around, and does not disappoint. The wow-factor of some of their other offerings puts this in perspective though as ""just"" a fantastic beer."
Saint Lamvinus,4.38,"Maceration of different grape varieties in two-year-old Lambic. Beer with a taste evolution. Bottled 7 November 2023.

Surprisingly restrained; vinous, mildly funky grapes with soft carbonation and fairly low acidity. Dangerously approachable, and so delicate."
Saint Lamvinus,4.29,"2023 vintage.

4.29/5: The first few sips didn't bowl me over, but it got so much better after half the glass; beautifully nuanced funk, light tartness (at best), and the delicately vinous nature make this an absolute winner"
Saint Lamvinus,4.5,Only had the 2015 vintage in 2023. Don't know what this tastes like fresh.
Society & Solitude #5,4.39,"With a blend of American and New Zealand hops, a well-engrained idea of what an imperial IPA should be. the talents at Hill Farmstead put their nose on the grindstone to develop the best taste possible from this hop medley. Society & Solitude #5 shows what's possible with the cooperation between the Pacific Northwest and the Land Downunder.

The foggy golden-straw beer takes the hues of sepia and puts it in a haze-infused and unadulterated pour. Its cottony swath of foam fills the room with a tantalizing fragrance of tropical, citrus and vinous fruits that wet the whistle by scent along. Its taste is succinct with the delicacy of sugar cookie and shortcake sweetness with a nearly tart interplay.

Its radiant fruit upstart soon makes way to a drying middle palate where the racy and radiant fruits come out to play- white grapefruit, branch-ripe orange, hints of lemon and white grape tease the tastebuds while the pulpy richness of under-ripened pineapple, passionfruit and kiwi round out the fruit punch and sherbet tangy-sweet flavor. Gooseberry, green tea and white wine finishes the session with those unapologetic urges of hemp, chive, verbena and earthy geranium.

Fuller in body, the beer's firm and smoothly bitter grip on the throat is balanced and bitter-sweet. Its soft resinous power of fresh spruce turns to lemongrass and fresh grass clippings before trailing with a dank and tart fruit aftertaste."
Society & Solitude #5,4.3,"16oz can dated 9/18/23.

Pours cloudy gold with an inch of dense white head. Persistent retention with plenty of spongy lacing. Melon, mango, bubblegum, white grape in the nose. Medium bodied with a soft mouthfeel. Ripe and tropical on the palate with minimal malt or bitterness on the palate. Honeydew, mango, wild grapes. Finishes juicy and ripe."

S: Candied grapefruit and lemon paired with fresh pineapple and strawberries.

T: Fresh grapefruit bitterness, tart lemon notes and subtle sweet hints of tropical fruits, white grapes and strawberries.

F: Very juicy and refreshing with a medium low carbonation.

O: Fantastic IPA. Highly complex and perfectly balanced. Best Society & Solitude I've had so far."
Truth,4.7,"Glossy black with a bubbly dark tan foam of moderate height.

Nose is ganache drenched walnut chocolate cake dunked in bourbon.

A mild viscosity tempered by a fine carbonation introduces flavors of nutty, vanillin heavy charred oak and dark chocolate before receding to a coffee-like acidity that turns back to mocha.

Even better than expected."
Truth,4.55,"This one pours a fairly dark black color, with a small head, and not much lacing.

This smells like roasted malt, char, vanilla, cookie dough, black cherry, dark chocolate fudge, and bourbon.

This is a barrel laden beast of a stout, in the best way. It’s charred and sweet, in balance, with roast, milk chocolate and dark chocolate both, with dried cherry, cookie dough, spiced vanilla, and espresso. There’s a ton of barrel here but it’s overall well integrated.

This is intensely flavored but well structured, and somehow quite drinkable and not all that boozy.

Tree House’s barrel program is so honed in at this point, I’ve enjoyed so many beers from them lately."
Truth,4.64,"Had on draft at Sandwich. Pours opaque,jet black in color with one inch head. Taste is big booze and whiskey, charred malt, fudge and vanilla. Heavy body, low carbonation, boozy. For a straight barrel Aged Imperial stout this is delicious...just enough sweetness and depth. Such a tasty beer."

Last Buffalo In The Park,4.7,"Review from my Untappd on Dec 26, 2018

Wow. The coconut on this is beautiful."
Last Buffalo In The Park,3.81,"Bottle share in Miami, FL. Looks fine. Smells great, if not a tad perfumey. Feels right.
But that’s where this smoke and mirrors game ends. This is an artificially flavored, pumped up fraud. Sickeningly sweet, glucose sticky. Those who know, know better. Never again. Yuck."
Last Buffalo In The Park,4.52,"Man, this beer RULED when I first had it. Definitely one to drink fresh and not age. Ton of coconut and barrel. I dont hear a ton about FB these days, but this beer was great!"
Black Gold,4.7,"2022 bottle split among friends.
L: Pours jet black, no head, very thin edge foam, no carbo, visible clinging of beer to sides of glass.
S: Chocolate cherry Black Forest chocolate moist cake, a hint of coffee, toffee, a halo of barrel.
T: Taste follows nose and is sweet. Chocolate, molasses, bourbon. Deeply roasted flavor without char. There are suggestions of dark berries, raisins, dates.
F: Smooth, silky heavy bodied with a long slick finish. It is very lightly oily.
O: An amazing tasting and drinking beer. Gushing with chocolate cake flavor and is a sipper. Soft bourbon and a silky feel and finish make this world class in its style."
Black Gold,4.07,"Dark brown pour, looks black in the glass; thin head. Nutty, woody smell. Rich dark malt taste; boozy; wheat. Heavy body; smooth; very warm.

Black Gold,4.75,"#136, yum!"
Black Gold,4.6,"2022 bottle; pours jet black with a thin head. Lots of barrel character on the nose. Cold, the flavors are chocolate on the front, barrel on the back. Warmer, the flavors integrate to barrel, chocolate and bourbon. Wonderful."
Black Gold,4.53,"Not getting much bourbon, but the barrel wood is really coming through. At first it seemed a tad bitter or tannic, but ten minutes or so of breathing mellowed that.
Very easy to drink. Solid all around. Thirty minutes out, there’s more sweetness and a bit more bourbon vibe. The base stout is,
for lack of better description and palate, a savory type, not sweet or chocolatey. Buy it if you see it."
Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,4.4,"Polished dark mahogany under an unevenly short, bubbly dark tan head.

The nose exhibits cigar skin, woody roast and a hint of blackberry.

The palate delivers formidable oak tannin with some punch, followed by a nutty yet tobacco roast. The exhale brings a little smoke and molasses riding on a gently warming plume.

After more than ten years of looking, I can't believe I've finally had this. I can see why this inspired Fred Karm, but it's also far more cohesive yet aggressive than I expected it to be, especially for being a five year old bottle."
Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,4.27,2019 version poured from a 25cl bottle into a snifter. Very pleasant aroma with decent thickness. Chocolate and light roast. Glad to finally tick this!
Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,5.0,"Närke Kaggen Stormakts Porter 2019

Yields a night black color with a smaller mohagony colored head.

The aromas lead with ground coffee, honey dipped milk chocolate and matured, spicy wood. There is a leathery quality in this, accompanied by lighter licorice and a note of caramel.

Mouthfeel on this is rich, heavier bodied with a well fitting, lower level of carbonation, which manages to unfold a late effervescence.

Taste offers strong notes of bitter chocolate, roasted espresso beans, dried figs and a well nuanced amount of rich sweet chestnut honey. Reveals an intriguing creaminess then with additional camp fire smoke on top, blending well into the bitter chocolate maltiness in this, together with a lighter note of caramel and mansion dust. Finishes with a lingering herb dryness, blending well into the coffee and chocolate bitterness in this, intensified by the warming, spicy and gnarly oak of the beer.

Fantastic, complex and intense with a great balance to it. This is as good as it gets regarding this style of beer with a beautiful, carefully way of crafting a complex, yet elegant beer."

Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,4.94,"Had low expectations. But, my gawd! This beer blew me away. Easily the best porter I’ve ever had."
Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,4.25,"Excellent Porter. One of the best. Roasty, complex, bold. Super challenging to acquire but definitely worth the chase. Got to try High Coast next to it too. Amazing combo!!!"
Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,4.63,"Pours jet black with a small tan head. Intense roast bordering on Smokey. Chocolate. Definitely some bourbon heat along with vanilla infused oak. Quite dry. Heat of the alcohol overwhelms my palate making tough to judge IBUs. Full bodied, long lasting finish."
Beyond Good And Evil,4.9,"#189, yummy!"
Beyond Good And Evil,5.0,"Smells like hot buttered rum and coffee liquor. Tastes divine. Bourbon barrels impart a very strong flavor. Rich. Dense. Smooth. Delicious. Incredible head, looks like espresso."

Beyond Good And Evil,5.0,"A perfect BA maple stout. Had on site at HF, was a 2018 vintage. Perfect."
Beyond Good And Evil,4.5,"2018 vintage on tap. Tan head. Black color (dark brown).

Smooth, silky, light roast, light heat. Awesome bourbon and fudge notes. The maple adds a nice light sweetness that goes well with the heat and roast from the barrels. Toasted marshmallow. Chocolate. Full bodied, great feel. Very surprised with how much I liked this as I haven’t enjoyed hill stouts in the past."
Beyond Good And Evil,4.56,"L -- Jet black in the glass with a surprisingly robust two finger head produced with aerated pour. Hard to believe this has been bottle conditioning for a year and a half
S -- Waves of rich milk chocolate, wet bourbon barrel, prune, fig, chocolate covered cherries, vanilla, maple, and light smoke. Smells like a pastry stout without being a pastry stout
T -- Incredible how much of a difference 18 months of barrel aging makes over the usual 10-12. The bourbon barrel presence is heavy here -- both in the notes of oak from the barrel itself but also the boozy bourbon heat. Very rich, mapley base stout that has both an espresso/dark chocolate character and a sweet fudginess. The bourbon is just a hair on the hot side
F -- Big mouthfeel, medium- carb. Lasting, sweet finish. Oily and slick, less velvety than expected
O -- One of the best barrel aged stouts I've had. Patience is the name of game when it comes to barrel aging, and Hill Farmstead has it in spades. Very pricey @$25/17 oz, but it's worth it

3rd Anniversary,4.49,"Poured into a snulip glass. It pours a turbid, muddy tangerine color with a creamy, milk-white head and thick, clinging lacing. A big, fruity nose with lemon, lime, pineapple, grapefruit, pine needles, and floral hops. The taste is superb with a great balance between tart lemon, lime, and grapefruit, and sweeter notes of pineapple, tangerine, peach, and some tropical fruit. Beneath is a creamy, oaty base that adds sweetness. It's dank but not overly bitter. The mouth feel is luxuriously plush and creamy with a perfect level of carbonation, and the 10% ABV is barely noticeable. Overall, this ale is outstanding and it's important to remember that it was first brewed 7 years ago. We've become accustomed to New England IPAs with heavy New Zealand hops. This must have been mind-blowing when first released."
3rd Anniversary,4.69,"Look - slightly slightly orangish thick milky yellow with a nice white head and sticky rimming and lacing

Gggreennn!,5.0,Aroma has notes of tropical fruits and citrus! Smooth on the palette and extremely tasty!!
Gggreennn!,4.25,Very good IPA but not in the same level as their King Julius. A fairly pretty good tropical aroma and taste but not overwhelming. Has a solid light orange color but lacks the juicy smooth taste like KJ. A definite bitter end taste but not too strong. Seems to lean more to a west coast IPA.
Gggreennn!,4.9,"#183, yummy!"

Feel - medium full body with a medium carb
Overall - pretty nice NE but still slight mix of a West coast"
Gggreennn!,4.68,"Treehouse Green, dialed up to 11. My favorite of the Green family. Like its slightly smaller brother, it's full of pineapple and grapefruit notes, with a lovely bitterness on the swallow that draws you back for another sip."

Profound grapefruit and pine aromas.
Guava, tangerine, pineapple, light green pepper flavors.
Creamy smooth mouthfeel, good carbonation, lightly sweet aftertaste.
Classified as an AIPA by Tree House, exceptional."
Gggreennn!,4.6,"Appearance: Pours a cloudy pear nectar color with a two finger head; good retention with shards and squiggles creating a wall of lacing

Smell: Dank and juicy aromatics with pineapple, lemon, apricot and tangerine pith

Taste: Very juicy from the outset, with pineapple and lemon forward with developing tangerine pith; moderate bitterness that grows into the finish with a hint of graham cracker sweetness underneath

Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with moderate carbonation; somewhat creamy

Overall: All of the ""Green"" series have been exemplary so far

Thanks, SpeedwayJim, for the opportunity"
Fundamental Forces,4.25,"100 rating like George Burnes on a cigar, here we go. Large and in charge like Veronica lake after a Martin or three, let’s ride. More solid than Robert Taylor as Ivanhoe, god save the king."
Fundamental Forces,4.54,"For the 2021 version! Sweet and rich chocolate malty, hint of vanilla, and hint of bourbon barrel nose on this one! Taste follows with a dark chocolate bitter, floral vanilla, and balanced boozy bourbon finish. A slight hint of age/oxidation can be detected on the backend, but this has aged/settled in extremely well for being about a year old. The bigboi booziness that you would expect at 17+% is there, but it is smooth and enjoyable...it starts to peek out a bit more as it warms. And, the mouthfeel is darn near perfect. Outstanding!"
Fundamental Forces,4.51,"Look - black thick syrup with slight rimming and lacing barely a head
Smell - a lot of vanilla bourbon barrel chocolate and booze
Taste - lots of vanilla chocolate great barrel
Feel - full body creamy light carb
Overall - really great beer"
Fundamental Forces,4.79,"Fundamental Forces is an Imperial Vanilla Stout from Bottle Logic. The one I drank had an ABV 17.17%, so a little stronger. I guess the Fundamental Force I got was the Strong Nuclear Force, the one with Gluons and Mesons. It's recommended with brownies. I didn't have brownies but my wife suggested oreo cookies but I thought that I didn't need to double it up. This beer is like 8 oreo cookies and that's enough. Maybe a little sweet, but it's good, very good, slightly boozy (well ABV 17.17%) but with all the other flavors that is not an issue.

Look: black with a half inch fluffy mocca colored head

Aroma: chocolate, vanilla, bourbon

Flavor: What stands out is the vanilla, the bourbon, the roasted malts, the coffee and chocolate.

Body/Overall: Full bodied, dessert in a bottle."
Chocolate Rain,4.0,"2024-05-26
750ml capped/waxed bottle served in a little Hoppin' Frog tulip-ish glass. 2014 vintage, #107pt2 12/5/13 15:09 002165 is faintly etched into the glass, label shows it at 18.5% abv. Gift to me by @2beerdogs in a face-to-face meetup which inevitably included an exchange of beer.

Pours dark brown, surprisingly not tarry black, with basically zero head on the pour. Nothing emerges afterward, either (which sometimes happens with huge stouts, in my experience). Smell is booze and chocolate. Searching around, I might get a little bit of charred oak and burnt coffee.

Taste is rich, rich chocolate. Booze is noticeable outgassing through the sinuses more than in the flavor itself, which is interesting. I get more toffee and vanilla in the flavor than I would have guessed from the aroma. Maybe some black licorice...but if so, it's fairly subtle.

Mouthfeel is surprisingly light...not to say it's light, it's just not dark matter like I would expect from the style, the brewery, and the abv. Very still, but not offputting. Overall, this is a very good ginormous stout that has stood up to a decade in the bottle quite well."
Chocolate Rain,4.37,2021: 20.2% ABV. Bottle pour dark as a moonless night with quickly dissipating foamy chocolate milk head leaving a scant ring of tiny bubbles. Nose is sweet roasty malt with cacao and vanilla present. Taste follows with more nibs and beans and a bit of alcohol creep lingering on the finish.
Chocolate Rain,4.47,"750 ml wax capped bottle, 2020 edition, 19.1% ABV, bottled 6/24/20. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with not quite an inch tan head that didn't stick around for too long. Small amount of lacing. I like the aroma, the brew smells like chocolate, vanilla, bourbon and roasted malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some burnt/charred malt, dark bread, oak, molasses and a bit of dark fruit. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's rich and coating with a moderate amount of carbonation. It's a little boozy but doesn't quite seem like it's 19.1% ABV either. I thought this was a pretty good overall brew, definitely worth trying if you ever get the chance!"
Chocolate Rain,4.5,"750ml bottle at share, 2015 vintage. Near black pour, small beig e head fades away. Aroma is roasty, dark chocolate, boozy with light fruity accents. Taste drops in raisins and prunes on top of the sweet roasty malts, full and creamy. Pretty damn warm too. Everything I have heard about this beer is true. A real classic that has aged well."
Chocolate Rain,4.08,"2021 vintage, 20.2% ABV."
Chocolate Rain,4.07,"This one pours a surprisingly thin dark brown that emits a fair amount of light around its edges; brief, cola fizz with no head, retention, or lacing. Nose has a leathery, molasses and salty licorice Black Tuesday backbone melded with semi-sweet chocolate chips. Some vanilla and oak as well. Nothing overpowering, and all the aromas feel like they're integrated into the beer, rather than an adjunct or flavoring that's thrown in on top and feels ""artificial."" Taste follows - it lacks the overpowering leathery and brackish boldish of Black Tuesday, but the cocoa additional doesn't tilt this sweet. Instead, it takes some of the rougher edges off BT while still maintaining an overall ""savory"" (or at least, no sweet) stout. Lots of alcohol, barrel, and bourbon spice lingers nicely on the loooong finish. Plenty of heat as well, but again, not overpowering. I do find the feel a little thing (similar to Gray Monday), but not everything needs the chew of BCBS. I still prefer BT, but this is a fine variant."
Chocolate Rain,3.8,"2017 vintage

It’s been a while, but I’m back with another BIF beer from @Eziel! This guy supplied me with some truly crazy stuff, and I’m hyped to try this one out. I really liked the raspberry cobbler Black Tuesday variant, so I have high hopes for this one too. Let’s dive into it

Pours a surprisingly light muddy brown with a finger of tan head that quickly fades to nothing and leaves no lacing

The nose here is quite pungent, perhaps an artifact of 5 year old vanilla beans and cacao nibs. I'm picking up on aromas of cocoa powder, raisin, dark chocolate, vanilla bean, heavily roasted coffee, hot bourbon, light toasted oak, and molasses

Whereas the nose was charmingly pungent, the taste is a bit sharp and aggressive. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting hot bourbon, burnt coffee, vanilla bean, dark chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, and molasses. The swallow brings notes of hot bourbon, toasted oak, vanilla bean, cacao nibs, black cherry, burnt coffee, toasted oak, and caramel

A full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a sharp and boozy (duh) beer. Finishes dry but with a serious alcoholic heat

Damn, I don't know if it was the age, but I really did not vibe with this one. It's hard to say if it was once well constructed, as it doesn't even really show a shell of what it used to be, save for the aroma. Hopefully the Black Tuesday Reserve he sent me is much better"
Chocolate Rain,4.57,"drinking a 2013 in 2022

Double Shot,4.49,Pours silky black with tan head that fades to a thin raft of bubbles. Smell is coffee and roasted malts. Taste is coffee and dark chocolate with a thick and coating mouthfeel. Beautifully executed coffee stout.
Double Shot,4.77,"6/23/24, anniversary trip to the brewery, finally made it!

What can I say, this got a well-deserved 100 on BA.

Amazing aromas: coffee, nutty, sweet

Full on sweet and creamy coffee in beer form, I'm in love."
Double Shot,4.6,"Looks like motor oil, completely opaque. Foam like dalgona coffee. Notes of molasses, vanilla, and coconut on the nose. Taste is nicely balanced, with tons of bittersweet chocolate. Nice mouthfeel, not too heavy. Overall a great stout, perfect for a late fall day."
Double Shot,4.42,"Appearance - The beer poured a silky black color with brown bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass.

Smell - the nose had a strong coffee presence with noted sweetness.

Taste -There was a lot of coffee here. Notes of chocolate syrup, and light vanilla we’re also present. It was not overly sweet to the point of being calling and allowing the coffee to shine. The coffee and chocolate continued in the finish.

Mouthfeel - The body was slick and not overly thick with small bubbles.

Overall - This is a great stout that coffee stout lovers will love."
Double Shot,4.36,"I usually like to sample a base beer before dipping into variants. However, when it comes to TH, I take what I can get when I can get it. So, I tried the Espresso version of this beer before sampling the OG version that is before me now.

Pours a deep dark brown-to-black color with over a finger of head that is milk chocolate in color. Like the Espresso variant, I am not overly impressed by the nose - some coffee, not much else.

The flavor profile is dominated by fresh black coffee. The bitterness off the roasted beans is the highlight here. The body is hearty and the finish has just enough residual sweetness to counteract the bitter coffee."
Double Shot,4.42,"Jet black body, opaque; thick, frothy, light brown head, long lasting; patchy splotches of foam stick to the glass. Rich dark roasted malt smell; cacao nibs and bitter chocolate. Rich and flavorful taste; fine blend of sweet and bitter chocolate; chocolate fudge and brownies; bourbon undercurrent; bitter. Heavy body; heavy sweetness throughout with a mild dryness at the finish.

Ah, a coffee stout, eh? After the fact I can sense coffee, but it's well-hidden on my palate. Still, this is a rich, decadent stout and quite the treasure.

JJJuiceee Machine,4.31,"I genuinely enjoy the Juice Machine family of beers, but, after sampling the base beer and Little Machine, I was left with the feeling that this line was not among the very best offered by TH.

The triple-J version makes the leap from very good to great! This version maintains its juiciness but also provides a potent dose of grapefruit-like bitterness to the finish."
JJJuiceee Machine,4.31,"I was expecting a more explosive galaxy profile. There is definitely mango in there. Maybe some nectarine. Definitely a bit ripe and green. Body is a little thick for me. It's definitely good. Not necessarily disappointed, but was expecting a more expressive experience from this one."
JJJuiceee Machine,4.5,"This series aren't my absolute fave from TH, but of course still world-class sauce that is an order of magnitude greater than most other brewers of the style. Just fantastic across the board, pretty much dead on to the brewer's description."
JJJuiceee Machine,4.38,"Canned 11/10/23. “Be kind” stamped on the bottom of the can

This Tree House trip brought me some more of the top 250 TH beers. It’s been a while since I’ve had anything this highly regarded from them, and Imm happy to finally tick it off. Let’s crack it open and find out what it’s all about

Pours a hazy yellow gold with 3 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

The nose is an interesting combination of gentle and dank. I’m picking up on aromas of grapefruit rind, white grape, dank weed, bready malf, lime zest, resinous hops, and overripe cantaloupe

It’s surprisingly smooth and balanced in taste but I really dig it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting orange zest, overripe cantaloupe, crackery malt, grassy hops, dank weed, mango skin, pineapple juice, and white grape. The swallow brings notes of orange zest, lime zest, white grape, jammy peach, bready malt, grassy hops, dank weed, and mango skin

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes mostly dry with a balanced bitterness

This is a great way to start tbis Tree House haul. I wouldn’t quite call it top 250 material but happy to have tried it nonetheless"
Parabajava,4.46,"A - Pours black with a fizzy tan head. The head fades into a thin ring leaving

S - Aroma is dark roasted coffee, vanilla and heavy bourbon barrel.

T - The taste is big black coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, caramel, charred oak and some nice bourbon heat.

M - Medium body with medium carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel with a soft slick finish.

O - Really top notch coffee stout."
Parabajava,4.83,"Appearance - The beer was deep black color with a mocha head crowning the glass.

Smell - So much coffee in the nose, accompanied by rich dark chocolate.

Taste - In the initial taste, there was a big wave of coffee. The coffee ran parallel to roasty dark chocolate. There were hints of cherry and coconut. The finish came with dry hints of the barrel.

Mouthfeel - With little carbonation, the beer was very smooth.

Overall - This was elite."
Parabajava,4.32,Rounded up to 4.5 based on general drinkability.
Parabajava,4.18,"Poured at 53°. Creamy light tan head with some rocks; good cap retention; heavy ring; sudsy lacing on agitation; medium thick legs; black body with ruby see through and good clarity. Bourbon and some mild roast coffee in nose; oak takes over as beer warms. Taste is bitter roast coffee, bitter sweet dark chocolate and oaky bourbon; a smidge of oaky vanilla in middle; black peppery oaky close. Medium body; silky feel, not adjuncty; alcohol burn on tip of tongue, warmth in mouth from 13.8% abv; dry wooden tongue coating/finish. Overall the beer tastes good but it’s too oaky for me; the coffee is bitter and the barrel notes push aside the base, i.e., oak dominates the whole and leaves a dry popsicle stick linger in my mouth."
Parabajava,4.47,"This is drier than most of its peers with a seemingly darker roast coffee as well. There really isn't much here besides bittersweet chocolate and intensely deep, dark coffee notes. The bourbon barrels are mellow but a welcome addition. Well incorporated bourbon and some oaky bite at the end. So damn good."
Parabajava,4.69,"2022 vintage, Drank 08/31/23
Pours a jet black with little carbonation. Strong aroma of morning coffee with chocolate syrup. Palate is choc covered espresso beans soaked in bourbon barrels. Great mouthfeel, with a gentle sweetness that’s not overpowering and very smooth given the ABV. Absolutely perfect and easily the best BA coffee stout I’ve had."
Parabajava,4.51,"Received as a gift from a kind friend - poured from a crowler (filled on 7/31/23 - enjoyed on 8/20/23) into a snifter.

Clear seal brown liquid rests beneath a beige crust, receding to a thin ring and surface slick. Gentle lacing; slick thin sheen of tears.

Chocolate, fine tobacco, molasses, black licorice, cherry pits, black coffee, and brown sugar in the nose - stupendous.

Boozy, oaky, toasty, lightly charred, with perhaps even more flavor (following the nose) in the finish than on the palate. Wave after wave of malt and barrel complexity. Bittersweet and almost but never quite smokey/spicy. Mild bitterness throughout, earthy/woodsy medium-dry finish with hints of black tea and bourbon.

Slippery, almost oily mouth-feel, with some residual tannins.

Forgot how good the base beer can be, and the coffee adds another layer of roast/fruit/bitterness without distracting from the character of the stout. Wonderful example of the style."
Parabajava,4.45,"12 ounce bottle into a snifter. 2022 edition, had 4/13/23.

Pours a mostly opaque dark brown, with a half inch foamy head and some foamy lacing. Aromas of coffee, bourbon, roasted malt, chocolate, oak, some char and cocoa, a hint of cherry. Flavors of intense coffee, roasted malt, bourbon, chocolate, oak. Smooth, a solid full body, appropriately carbonated.

The coffee is prominent, bold and outstanding. The barrels show well, the base is solid, the feel is great. Will buy this anytime it is available."
Parabajava,4.49,"2022 vintage

When I first tride OG Parabola I quite enjoyed it, but honestly had higher expectations. And I think coffee would improve upon the base beer, so I’m hopeful for this one. Let’s crack open this legendary variant of a legendary beer and see what it’s all about

Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of frothy tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

It’s definitely punchy in the nose, somewhere between roasty and bitter white still presenting a nice sweetness. I’m picking up on aromas of cacao nib, earthy hops, roasted espresso, molasses, burnt toast, toasted oak, vanilla, light brown sugar, and tobacco

It trends much more bitter in taste, but that underlying sweetness helps things from getting out of hand. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting molasses, earthy hops, cacao nib, dark roast coffee, plum, rye toast, burnt caramel, light vanilla, and brown sugar. The swallow brings notes of cacao nib, dark roast coffee, burnt toast, toasted oak, black cherry, caramel, earthy hops, light plum, and molasses

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes dry and roasty

Yeah, this is definitely better than the original, the coffee is just the kick it needs. Maybe I’ll get to try some other variants some day"
Parabajava,4.37,"Look - love the thick blackness with a nice thick tan head great rimming and lacing
Smell -roasted malt and coffee, barrel slight dark fruit
Taste -roasted malt coffee dark chocolate barrel, slightly bitter
Feel -creamy full body light carb
Overall - pretty great"
Parabajava,4.13,"Aroma is boozy bourbon with a bit of classic chocolaty stout -- jammy molasses and plum. Body is strong with bourbon followed shortly by roasty coffee, and the two combine to make something like a mounds bar with a swig of strong black coffee. One of the best examples of a good barrel aged stout out there."
Parabajava,5.0,04/27/23 bottle @ home
Parabajava,4.52,"Pitch black pour with a full brown head. The nose is great: espresso added to usual parabola, but the barrel not cut at all. Taste is coffee and chocolate forward, barrel is rustic, roasted malt parabola base is still great. Body is a touch thinner but still earthy, rustic, and boozy with roast. This is well done but I like the original best still"
Notorious Triple IPA,4.57,"12oz can (packaged 7/2/2024) into a tulip. Pours a pale golden color with a frothy white head, sudsy lace.

Aroma is monstrous tropical citrus along with dank sticky resinous pine. Yes. Smells like rubbing a handful of hop cones together.

The beer hits the palate hard with an unapologetic bitter hop bite, resinous and chewy. Behind that are copious hop oils and alpha acids that give off an explosion of citrus flavors—grapefruit mostly, like licking the inside of the rind. Definitely an underlying layer of pale malt sweetness too, like peaches maybe a day past peak ripeness. Finishes again with a tingling sharp hop bite. Bold and assertive, but still balanced. This contains 11.5% alcohol?

Mouthfeel is medium to heavy bodied, sticky, chewy. Nice warming finish.

Overall a truly lovely beer—not subtle or nuanced—but wonderful all the same.

Medium orange, with amber highlights, for the look. Solid amount of toasted grain, caramel malt, tangerine peel, for the aroma. Lots of tangerine peel, caramel malt flavors. The extra malt, tames the hop bite, as usual."
Notorious Triple IPA,4.16,"Hoppy and piney, with bitter grapefruit that counterbalances the alcohol sweetness from the tripe IPA makes it surprisingly drinkable for 12% abv."
Notorious Triple IPA,4.4,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a two finger white head with great retention and solid lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, orange, mild mixed tropical fruit and pine;a touch of green onion. Flavor is lightly caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, mixed tropical fruit and pine needles. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. So great to find an traditional triple IPA with real malt flavor, lots of fruit and pine and substantial bitterness in the finish. I was struck but the mild sweetness of this one, but with all the mixed fruit it fit perfectly. Some hotness, but plenty of flavor to cover the ABV well. Boneyard has always pleased with IPAs and I'm not sure why I've never seen this one in my area before. I'll be looking for it in the future. Excellent."
Notorious Triple IPA,4.46,"Look: Nearly clear rich orange with a reddish hue and the pour yields a thick pure white head that pillows up and slowly recedes, leaving great lacing behind
Aroma: I could smell it before I got close to the glass. Sweet orange, peach, strawberries, pine sap, cantaloupe, a little Cannabis, rich honey-like sweetness, ruby-red grapefruit, Hawaiian bread, tangerine, and an ever-so-slight ethanol waft
Taste: Whoa. A huge rush of mixed citrus fruits storm onto the palate as honey-like sweetness and berries start to mix in. Pine and dank herb appear from time to time and malt sweetness is ever-present and closes with a big hop bite and alcohol heat
Mouthfeel: Full, slick, slightly cloying but far from palate-taxing, and decently dry on the finish along with some alcohol heat
Overall: This is a big-time beer and a good one at that. This was my first time with this beer in years and was pumped when I saw they had finally canned it (or packaged it at all) but glad it’s not around often as it’s a huge Triple IPA and it shows. Tons of hops, tons of malt sweetness, boozy, and unabashedly so - you know it’s big but doesn’t drink like it’s 11.5%. A well done and tasty IIIPA. Recommended."
Notorious Triple IPA,4.35,"Growler filled 10 days ago in Portland and arrived in MA.
Not filled super high on the neck, but carb was super solid.
Really great Old Money beer. Super solid TIPA from back in the day. No haze at all, super clear. Super tasty. Seek it out!"
Sunday Brunch - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.26,"2023 vintage; consumed on 9/25/2023

Pours a silky, jet-mahogany body capped with two and a half fingers of soapy, beige foam; solid head retention leaves a slim-none cap over an otherwise dense void, paper-thin collar, and minimal, temporary webs of lacing holding to the walls of the glass.

Aromas of fragrant coffee abound, sporting a vanilla inflection and subtle roast atop a delicate maple saturation; a deft cinnamon edge presents through the back end of the bouquet while a soft bourbon inflection lingers.

Taste features airy cocoa touched with coffee roast, with a touch of vanillins imbuing a char revisited over the mid-palate; soft maple settles into the back end, informing heavy dark cocoa into the finish as supportive cinnamon fades through the swallow.

Mouthfeel offers a medium body and moderate carbonation, fading as subtle roast coats and a slick, balancing texture washes over the mid-palate; creaminess into burgeoning warmth settles through the back end while a wispy, semi-bitter prickle finishes.

Expressive coffee welcomes sleek vanilla, with bourbon simultaneously softening roast and mediating a beautifully deft cinnamon accent; an expertly done combination of adjuncts, layered over the profile approachably and with purpose."
Sunday Brunch - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.71,"All high ABV porters should be bourbon barrel aged in my opinion. This one is and well done. Super dark in color with a light brown head. Nose is bourbon and caramel. Taste is like toasted cane sugar and caramel. The slight burn from the ABV is not overwhelming, yet has a bit of hang around power. The feel goes all the way down the esophagus."

Emperor Julius,4.87,"16 oz can dated 8/2/24

Orangey tan colored murk. Two fingers fine white head. Full lacing curtains, surface ring and continents. No floaties nor sediment.

Strong orange, melon aromas.

Orange, light pineapple, tropical fruit flavors.

Soft full mouthfeel, good carbonation, spiky bitter aftertaste.

Super enjoyable imperial IPA, a nice riff on the Julius bloodline."
Emperor Julius,4.53,"Appearance - The beer looks a bit like an Arnold Palmer with darker orange toward the bottom.

Smell - Orange forward nose with little noted bitterness.

Taste - The profile was very apricot/peach forward. Initially, this was quite refreshing. The beer became somewhat peppery in back with light bitterness.

Mouthfeel - The viscosity allowed the peppery notes to abuse the back of the throat.

Overall - The very very accessible."
Emperor Julius,4.44,"Gifted a can by Drew. Poured into TH snifter. Opened/began with rush of plumy white head; hazy apricot/ yellow body. Nose fruity citrus; melon; biscuit and resin…somewhat subdued from can and glass. Taste mirrors with greater orange fwd (as promised). Body began as smooth velvet, but became more brisk after about 1/3 glass consumed. Overall an excellent NE style DIPA. Began as a stunner, but evolved into a still great brew but not as extraordinary as hoped."
Emperor Julius,4.4,"Apricot juice color. Cloudy. Impressively large head from a gentle pour. Many rings of chunky lace left on the glass as the beer is consumed.

Initial impression is of orange rind, light caramel, and deeper toasted bread. Light hop bitterness is like a subtle spice. Softly sweet.

There are flavors of dried apricot and rye bread. The hop is stronger than the smell suggests bringing forward a black pepper bite. Fuller body and fine carbonation. The finish is a blend of semisweet caramel, warming alcohol, and prickly pepper. Soft but lingering aftertaste."
Emperor Julius,4.27,"Pours a completely opaque, thicc looking drab orange color. Thick, frothy, off-white head forms on the beer, lingers for a moment, then dissipates leaving just a small mound of residual foam. Sticky lacing coats the glass as the beer is consumed. Aroma has notes of guava, passionfruit, orange, citrus, and some tropical fruits. Absolutely lovely on the nose.

Taste somewhat follows the nose - those fruity notes are there - orange, passion fruit, and guava amongst others - but the flavor profile is decidedly less fruity than the nose implied. Moderate hoppy bitterness comes through in the profile. Nice balance between the fruity sweetness and the hoppy bitterness. Feel is thick, a bit heavy, and very full bodied. Nice carbonation for as heavy as the beer actually ends up being.

Overall it is a lovely NEIPA - a testament to the quality of Tree House."
Moment Of Clarity,4.67,"I had no idea that a stout could taste like this, flat out delicious, if a little sweet. But somehow it works so very well. The feel is more like a BBA Stout but it’s not. Wow, I want a case of this."
Moment Of Clarity,4.12,"Pours a bit more viscous than most classic stouts with a warm tan head. This beer is roughly 8mo old so the nose isn’t super pronounced but is not unsatisfying. Very faded coffee and chocolate w maple syrup. Body is definitely syrupy and a bit sticky.

Nice to have a stout packing this much flavor at only 7.7%.

It’s definitely solid now, but know this beer would absolutely crush while fresh."
Moment Of Clarity,5.0,"Awesome beer, malty and soothing to the taste buds!"
Moment Of Clarity,4.9,"#186, yummy!"
Moment Of Clarity,4.58,Pours a deep dark brown-to-black color with a finger and a half of tan head. The nose is ludicrously good - it smells like milk chocolate syrup poured over crushed bittersweet chocolate pieces! The flavor faithfully follows the nose. The body is hearty for the style and the mouthfeel is sticky sweetness galore.
Moment Of Clarity,5.0,Milkshake quality. Truly delicious
Modem Tones - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Vanilla,5.0,"Near perfect, had in 2019"
Modem Tones - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Vanilla,4.56,"On tap at Modern Times Fermentorium. Pours black with pretty much zero head. The nose is phenomenal. Tons of vanilla, marshmallow, chocolate, and bourbon. The taste follows, with massive amounts of vanilla leading the way. Just a lovely viscous stout."
Modem Tones - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Vanilla,4.56,"12oz can courtesy of Dimidiata. Been sitting on it for a bit, and decided it would be an excellent Valentine for myself.

Poured into a snifter, it was the color of the mood of Philadelphia Eagles fans right now. Virtually no head besides a very thin line of tan bubbles around the rim. Not a great looking beer, but it's not surprising considering how strong it is.

As expected, it smells like a big Stout brewed with the adjunct ingredients of vanilla and bourbon barrels, with an unexpected touch of what smells like Graham crackers. Smells like a luscious dessert.

Tastes like it smells, but better. It's not a subtle beer, but you don't drink beers like this for subtlety. The bourbon Barrel flavor is fairly mellow and refined, and the vanilla is at a level that melts well with that, unlike a lot of beers I've had with vanilla added to it. That Graham crackery thing I noticed in the nose is present in the taste as well. I do not believe any graham crackers were abused in the making of this beer, perhaps it's a byproduct of the vanilla and bourbon mixing. It is utterly delicious, that's for sure.

Fairly creamy mouth feel, body is somewhere between medium and full.

This is a glorious dessert beer. Perhaps also my last from Modern Times. But, hey, they're going out on a high note with me. Thanks, Christine!"
Modem Tones - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Vanilla,4.71,"Look - Black thick nice tan rimmin and lacin
Smell & Taste - loads of barrel along with really nice vanilla and chocolate
Feel - thick and creamy with a light carb
Overall - fantastic and a must have

Had a 2020 in 20204, still fantastic but more like 4.5"
Modem Tones - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Vanilla,5.0,"2020 version poured from a 22oz. bottle into a snifter at home on 12/4/2021. For a vanilla lover like myself, the vanilla aroma and flavor as well as the viscosity of this beer is wonderful."
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.31,"Canned version. Pours an effervescent chestnut/mahogany with one finger of rapidly falling mocha colored head. No head retention or lacing

S: Some barrel notes, coffee, some brown sugar notes once warmed up, plus vanilla. Sort of tails off as it warms

T: Follows the nose, oaky dryness, dark chocolate, hints of vanilla & leafy hops, roastyness as well up front. More coffee, Baker's Chocolate, oaky dryness& a little bit of booze smack as this beer warms up, coconut also asserts itself & just a little bit of barrel twang. Finishes with plenty of coffee, dark chocolate, plus good amounts of coconut, vanilla & barrel & a little leafy hop

MF: Medium body, restrained carbonation, warming & a little sticky

This is about as coffee forward as you can get on a BA Imp Stout for me to really enjoy it, all flavors are in harmony. A bit of a sipper to be sure. I do wonder if this is better from the bottle. If everything was as good as the flavor A++ Just an A/A+ instead"
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.96,"L: Dark pitch black as it should be with no light at all. Looks very thick.
S: Dark chocolate, Dark coffee roast, some faint dark fruit, and bourbon barrel age is well hidden.
T: Absolutely heavenly and smooth with the flavors mentioned under the smell. Does not feel like an 11% ABV beer, yet you get the effects afterwards.
F: Thick, smooth, and luscious.
Overall: This is the best Imperial Stout that I've had and it's not even close. I first had this in 2021 during the warm weather months and it's truly better than even KBS."
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.32,"Very good head production, but retention is lacking, fading to only the thinnest possible ring around the rim of the glass before long. Body is a lovely obsidian hue, cola-like along the edges.

Aroma is quite strong, prominently featuring the bourbon. Notes of bourbon mash, brown sugar, oak, leather, red grape, cherry, coconut, syrup.

Flavor absolutely delivers on a classic, BCBS-like BBA imperial stout. Lots of bourbon, but not overpowering; moderate char; bitter, but not overly hoppy nor too roasty, coming across on the more restrained side of RIS. Toffee, ginger cookies, raisin, coffee, prune, bourbon, oak, leather, white pepper, blackstrap molasses.

Exceptionally easy to sip, savor, and chew, despite the ABV and barrel influence. Does finish fairly hot on the back third, letting you know just how big it is.

This is an excellent BA RIS, with tons of complexity and an admirable restraint on all fronts. It's supremely drinkable, and less rich than most others, without sacrificing flavor. That said, I personally wish it delivered more richness along with that complexity, perhaps just a touch more sweetness and thickness. I also favor AIS over RIS, which certainly influences my take on this one."
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.23,"Plead the 5th from Dark Horse Brewing. 12 oz can. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Received from @Whyteboar in NBW BIF #16. Reviewed 05/12/22. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Undated can. Served at 53.4 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 57.7 degrees.
Appearance – 3.5.
First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), clear.
Body – Brown (SRM 20), opaque. Under direct light, same. When rear lite, opaque except at the edges – bottom edge ruby, top edge olive.
Head – Average (Maximum 1.2 cm, aggressive center pour), buff, high density with a few surface rocks, quickly diminishing to a 0.1 – 0.15 cm crown and a thin island.
Lacing – None. Not much expected at 11% ABV.
Aroma – 4.25 – Chocolate, weak char, and some hints of bourbon. No hops, no yeast.
Flavor – 4.5 – Chocolate and slight char with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Bourbon not detected. Slight oakiness. No hops or yeast. No ethanol (11 % ABV as marked on label) aroma or taste. Moderate gastric warming occurs. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.
Palate – 4 – Medium, dry side of creamy, soft but lively carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4 (After deducting 0.25 point for undated personal container) Look unremarkable, pretty much like every other high ABV RIS or Impy stout. Aroma is fairly typical but has a char note that many lack and lacks the coffee notes that many have. Bourbon is present on the nose but seems absent in the taste. The taste also has both chocolate and char as well as an oakiness from vanillin but lacks the tannin notes. As the temperature reaches the end, some bourbon notes finally appear. Overall, a good RIS that’s certainly more subtle than most."
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.18,I had a 2016 and was curious what 6 years of aging would do. Definitely mellowed it out a bit and knocked off the rougher edges. Mostly left with a mellow oak and vanilla bourbon flavor over a nice toasty base stout. Quite nice.
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.32,"Look - Fantastic black and thick with a really nice thick foamy tan head
Smell - dark chocolate caramel molasses roasted malts boozy and bourbon woody smells
Taste - chocolate coffee with that woody caramel molasses bourbon barrel from the get go. Slight dark fruit and vanilla in the back with a little bit of bitterness
Feel - medium full body with a very light carb. Could use a little more thickness to it in my opinion but still nice
Overall - Really nice Classic BA Russian Imperial. Very complex with a ton of smells and flavors."
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.58,Pours jet black like used motor oil. Has a medium dark caramel head on top. Gives off a burnt coffee smell. Taste of roasted burning malts. Barrel is nowhere to be found. Overall beer is delicious!!
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.36,"12 oz can poured into a snifter at 55 degrees F. Side by side tasting with Plead the 5th:
L - dark and silky with a dark hazelnut head that quickly evaporated
S - bourbon, molasses
T - lots of bourbon, drowns out most of the other flavor, bit of molasses on the finish
F - thick mouthfeel with medium carbonation
O - good, settles down nicely a bit after being decanted, the bourbon fades a bit and coffee and molasses flavors become more prominent"
Double Nelson,4.98,"Heavy tropical fruit on the nose.

Taste, a touch of pine, heavy on the tropical fruit with a touch of resin. Incredible balance, mouthfeel could be a touch better but otherwise a damn impressive beer."
Double Nelson,4.25,"Can. White head. Lace. Hazy golden orange color.

This is good, but some of their pales and singles are better imo. Funny to see which ones get hype and make the top 250 list. This honestly is a bit light on flavor in comparison to some of their lesser abv hops. Still juicy and tropical. Mango, papaya, orange, melon. Also some bitterness. Floral and pine. It’s good, just can’t see why the avg rating is so high on this specific offering."
Double Nelson,4.75,"This is the probably the best Nelson hopped IPA I have ever put my nose, lips and tongue to. HFB's balance and soft mouth feel, just a fantastic DIPA."
Double Nelson,3.59,"Canned July 2nd, 2024.

Good looking beer, highlighted by a dense white head that had excellent retention. Aroma doesn't burst from the glass, but up front there are plenty of really nice tropical fruit notes.

Taste has plenty of mixed tropical fruit notes, with a moderate level of bitterness on the finish. Feel is a little thinner than I would have expected.

Overall, I guess I can see why IPA lovers like this beer.........but I'm not an IPA lover."
Double Nelson,4.29,"On tap at Sabatinis in Exeter pa late this afternoon.

Splendid looking beer. Hazy pale amber body with a strong persistent white head. The lacing is truly spectacular, dripping rings. Soft tropical fruit aroma, very strong nelson hop taste, slightly warming, tempered bitterness. The hop profile gives a lasting finish. Another great beer from Hill Farmstead."
Double Nelson,4.37,"Look - Slight haze orangish yellow with slight white head nice rimming
Smell and Taste - crisp grainy earthy citrus with a slight tropical, complex and a lot there
Feel - light crispness
Overall - pretty nice"
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.6,"Pours deep, silky black. Aroma is wonderful mix of dark chocolate, coffee, malty, bourbon and vanilla. Taste excels. Rich sweetness and well balance combination of chocolate, bourbon and vanilla (much more present than in aroma), hints of coffee and maltiness. Full mouthfeel. Incredible stout."
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.34,"12 ounce bottle poured into a Firestone Walker taster’s snifter, in Toulouse, France. (One of the beers I brought from the USA 7 months ago.) There’s a bracelet of foam that lingers round the top of the black brew. No retention cuz there’s nothing to retain.
Nose is dry woodsy bourbon and espresso.
Taste is bourbon barrel, roasty malt, a little char, and quite alcohol forward., There is dark chocolate and coffee, but this is almost straight hot bourbon. Late in the taste, it finally settles down enough to allow some vanilla and hops whisper through. There are few subtle notes. It’s overkill, really, and the base brew is overwhelmed.
Mouthfeel is light for such heaviness. Carbonation is relatively low.
Overall, Speedway’s base Stout and coffee addition is damn good. Dumping it in a bourbon barrel is like a really beautiful woman wearing way too much makeup.
But it’s still really good.,.."
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.47,"Enjoyed with a friend. Sent to us by a friend: @Resistance88
Poured oil-like into our glasses, black as a moonless night and capped with a brown head they left reasonable lacing.
Sadly, my nose is Covid damaged and the aroma was too faint for me to properly describe.
The taste though - Speedway is one of our favorite stouts as it is, and this one is easily just as tasty, just differently so. More smooth and bourbon like heat that accompanies the existing coffee and dark chocolate flavors; all bitterness from the coffee or malt roast is gone. If BBA stouts are a treat for you, seek this out.
The feel is soft and the visible viscosity doesn't let me down. It feels like a high ABV stout and seems to need all that body to carry the amount of flavor packed into this."
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.44,"Poured a dark chocolate fudge with half finger light brown head. Excellent lacing throughout the tasting. Nose was good, though muted - soft vanilla and barrel. Taste was more forward with the vanilla, barrel, light coffee, and some chocolate. Overall, very good beer. Would prefer a bit more barrel and a bit more coffee."
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.67,"Pours inky black with a thick mocha head that leaves spotty lacing. Aroma is dark chocolate, oak, vanilla, bourbon. Flavor follows the nose, heavenly chocolate cake, bourbon and vanilla. Feel is thick and lightly carbonated. Overall, the bomb."
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.47,"(2023 version, 16 oz can, canned on 10/10/2023; purchased cold yesterday at the brewery... poured into a stemless wine glass)

L: darn near black liquid with an ample build of a relatively dark brown head... the head hangs for a bit, but falls, but why then is its lacing so purdy??... razor thin collar maintains

S: dark chocolate cake, espresso ganache, hint of charcoal... powerful grain and toasty cookie character... nutty accents and a prune brandy booze note slowly emerge... bourbon is not immediately apparent I think due to the heavy dark malty aromas, but delicate wood and vanilla overtones eventually meld with the rest of its potent snuffables

T: the bourbon barrel influence leaps out upon first sip but soon gets swallowed by the muddy, motor oily, muscular malts... cindery heat, burnt raisiny... thick malty but not all that sweet(?!?); the aftertaste seems dry; all suggestive byproducts

F: full bodied is pretty spot on, however, it has a slick, lithe texture likely from being smoothed with aging, not to mention the attenuating effect of the jet fuel booze... gets fluffier as it goes?... it's levity is phenomenal, but I like my legs

O: it doesn't quite have the subtle idiosyncratic nuances of the best batches of standard Bourbon County, but why am I comparing them?... Eh, tempting to ship home (2273)"
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.3,"16oz can pours out that inkish black that's so familiar in Speedway, with a decent-sized tight-bubbled light khaki head. Prominent barrel notes of bourbon and oak abound, along with present coffee and hints of smoke...rich and sweet on the palate, the barrel-aging seems well-executed here. Definitely worth trying, I liked this variant more than the Vietnamese coffee version; this one just seemed more cohesive, roasty, rich, and pleasant."
King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,5.0,"Color: DDH King Sue pours a hazy golden-orange with a rich, slightly creamy appearance, typical of New England-style IPAs. Its opacity is inviting, and a thick, white frothy head crowns the beer, leaving excellent lacing as it settles.
Aroma: The aroma bursts with tropical fruits, led by a strong scent of mango, pineapple, and citrus, especially grapefruit and tangerine. There’s also a hint of peach and papaya, complemented by underlying pine and resin notes. The double dry-hopping of Citra hops shines through, delivering a vibrant, juicy nose.
Palate: On the palate, DDH King Sue is smooth and juicy, with a pillowy mouthfeel. The tropical flavors from the aroma carry over, with ripe mango, pineapple, and passion fruit dominating. A slight citrus bite balances out the sweetness, while the hop bitterness is present but not overpowering. The soft carbonation and hazy body give it a velvety texture, making it incredibly drinkable for a Double IPA.
Overall: DDH King Sue is a standout New England-style Double IPA. Its combination of intense tropical fruit flavors, a balanced hop profile, and smooth mouthfeel make it both bold and approachable. Fans of juicy, hazy IPAs will find this beer a real treat, showcasing why it’s so highly regarded in the craft beer community. Despite its higher ABV (around 7.8%), it remains refreshing and easy to enjoy."
King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.55,"Cloudy orange color, like fresh orange juice with pulp, with a modest off white head.
The aroma is tropical fruit and tart citrus.
The taste is mango, pineapple, grapefruit and tangerine overdose, slightly sweet, tart and mildly bitter nicely balanced for loads of flavor. The finish is dry with loads of citrus zest bite.
The body is medium, plenty of good carbonation, crisp but very drinkable with a well hidden ABV. Altogether, this is another great super hazy IPA from Toppling Goliath, almost hop overload but luscious, outstanding."
King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.46,"A - Pours out semi-translucent pale orange, short white head, fading pretty quickly to a nothing. Not much lacing, really.

S - Fruit nectar, primarily, a tropical element hard to put a finger on, but a strong citrus undercurrent, mostly grapefruit.

T - Follows the nose, with a big tropical juice note, more clearly pineapple and passionfruit, mango and a touch of peach, that flows into a citrus hit of orange and grapefruit in the middle, and a subtle bitterness of pith, with powerful acidity in the finish.

M - Strong acidity and moderate carbonation do battle against the heavier juice notes, scrubbing away most of the weight. A dry finish leaves just a touch of resin in the close.

O - I do like this one, with huge juice notes and just enough bitterness to remind you this is still a beer you are drinking. Lovely, and satisfying."
Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,4.51,"Poured from a can into a snifter. Pours hazy orange yellow with a small white head. Smells of citrus and grassy hops with floral notes. Tastes of bright citrus with some creamy notes. Beer is medium bodied with a nice smooth finish, good carbonation. Overall, a superb beer."
Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,4.52,"Look - bright hazy orange with a nice white head sticky rimming and lacing
Smell - tropical fruit and slightly floral
Taste - floral peach and citrus tangerine with a slight floral and sweetness
Feel - Medium full body, fluffy, creamy... medium carbonation
Overall - Really fantastic IPA, wish the smell was a little more but still fantastic"
Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,4.9,"#148, yummy!"
Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.43,"Poured from a 16 ounce can into a Tulip Glass, ""PKG 03/29/24"".

APPEARANCE: pours a dense, cloudy, golden color with one-finger, off-white head that slowly dissipated until a thin, broken layer of small bubbles remained, medium carbonation, there is some lacing on the glass, in a word beautiful!

SMELL: pleasantly understated, notes of sweet pineapple citrus and mango then bread.

TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially sweet pineapple and mango then bread and finishes with a very pleasant dank taste.

PALATE: medium body and carbonation, somewhat creamy.

OVERALL: this is a spectacular Pale Ale, I will buy this again for sure and will tell all my friends about it, I recommend to anyone who likes craft beer, Toppling Goliath is one of the best brewers there is, right there with Sierra Nevada, can't wait to try more beers from them."
Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.61,"So drinkable, crushable, or just plain sip worthy. The ultimate juicy pale ale in a DDH version. This is a don't miss beer."
Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.41,"Pint can, very fresh, in a good old pint glass.

Yellow-orange citrus looking color. Hazy with a clouded aura and color variation. Soft white head, below 1F, a few spots of lacing at best.
*When I cracked a 2nd in a different, yet same style, glass, the head was massive and the lacing was bubbly and sticky so I’m popping up the look rating.*

Lemon and light orange citrus aromas along with mango and unsweetened beer.

The citrus fruit drives the flavor. Slightly tropical with light pale malt in the background.

The malt comes through to a solid medium bodied pale ale. Hop bite to start that moves to a soft dry finish. Lasting flavor and feel.

Very good hoppy pale ale. The malt balances the strong hops and kicks back any juice. Likeable!"
Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.19,"Poured from a can into a pint glass. Pours hazy yellow orange with a small white head. Smells of bright citrus with some pine notes. Tastes of grassy and citrus hops. Beer is light bodied and easy drinking, good carbonation. Overall, a very good beer."
Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.35,"On tap, pours a moderately hazy orange. Smell and taste showcase the Citra, with citrus, tropical fruits and musky, herbal notes. Really nice beer, enjoyable."
Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.47,"Not a baby, born around three months ago.
Peach juice like appearance with a thick head with great retention and leaving laces.
Bold aroma with predominant notes of mango, pine and oranges.
Flavor with notes of resin, fresh oranges, pineapple, peaches, oats and some dankness. Dry and bitter aftertaste. Quite rounded.
Light to medium velvety body with appropriate carbonation of tiny bubbles.
Beef up version of Pseudo Sue with similar tropical and citrusy fresh notes and a pinch of dank-resin. A tad more intense than the original. Showcase for an American Pale Ale."
In Perpetuity,4.25,"Pours cloudy orange color with a 2 finger white foamy head that faded slowly and left decent foamy lacing. Smells of tangerine, lemon zest, grapefruit, tea leaf, honeydew melon, coriander and light peppery spices. Tastes of red grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, tea leaf, honeydew melon, orange peel, caramel, wheat bread/sweet malt, coriander and light peppery spices. Well balanced and easy drinking, this was a nice IPA."
In Perpetuity,4.43,"From January 13, 2024 via my Untappd ""Wow. I've been actively avoided hazies, but Tree House is always a treat. This is great!"" Shout out to my buddy for the share!"
In Perpetuity,4.5,"Pours a very hazy mango color with a fluffy white head that coats the glass with ringlets of lacing. Gorgeous hazy. The nose is crammed with dank citrus notes, primarily mango, tangerine, and lemon zest, with some subtle white grape notes for good measure. Wow.

The taste follows that script, with the mango and tangerine most prominent and delicious, with the lemon zest and white grape lurking, and some sweet oats at the back of the palate, coasting into a pillowy mouthfeel and a surprising bit of lingering bitterness.

I like this more than Julius. Yes, I typed that. World class stuff here."
In Perpetuity,5.0,I live down the road from TH. I've had more of their IPAs than I can count. This is one of their best.
In Perpetuity,4.5,"From a three-week-old can stamped LOVE IS LOVE, pours a bright, hazy orange. Smell and taste combine citrus, white grape and earthy herbs. A lot of flavor at a lower ABV, as IPAs go."
In Perpetuity,3.9,"Canned on 6/30/23; consumed on 7/11/23

Pours an opaque, dark orange body topped with multiple fingers of thick, fluffy, eggshell-white foam; great head retention leaves a half-finger of cap, large collar, and a dense walling of chunky lacing surrounding the glass.

Aroma opens to a waxy Nelson-dank accented with white grape pith as a flaky cereal grain undertone expands; hints of white peppercorn ease through notes of musty lemon and grass on the back end of the bouquet.

Taste brings mandarin peel, grapefruit, and an underlying hint of key lime as musty white grape meets lemon bubblegum over the mid-palate and a flaky grain lingers on through the profile.

Mouthfeel shows a medium body and moderate carbonation, dispersing tautness into silky textures as a slight creaminess prevails, leaving a glossy fade through resinous undertones on the finish.

A steady, well-attenuated dankness rife with tropical overlay; a standard NEIPA in the ever-quaffable Tree House rotation."
In Perpetuity,4.53,"Poured from 16-ounce can into a thin-walled crystal goblet. Hazy pale yellow, with a two-finger white head that left scads of pretty lacing. Big burst of grapefruit upon opening the can, and it only got better. Loads of grapefruit, orange, and tropical fruit on the nose and palate (think breakfast juice). Very low bitterness, with hints of citrus zest lingering on the finish. Satisfying mouthfeel, very juicy. Well balanced and very drinkable, i.e. goes down easily and you just want to keep drinking it. First time with Tree House, and I'm suitably impressed. Highly recommended."
Wide Awake It's Morning,4.41,"Review from Jan 5, 2019 via my Untappd

4.25+. Very very good but no bacon/smokey quality."
Wide Awake It's Morning,4.05,"Viscous jet with not much in the way of head retention; maple syrup nose with some deeper wood; dark rock candy, tree bark, smoke, coffee bean; chewy yet dry and smooth.

3.75 4.25 4 4 4

Cigars! Something leafy and woody yet smoky, too…
After an intoxicating nose, this turns into a wrestling match between three big flavors: candy sweetness, oily bean, and wood smoke.
The maple is tree more so than syrup, the bacon is just smoke + salt rather than any mouth-watering savouriness, and the coffee’s just dropped out a bit.
In the end the big sweetness doesn’t hang together with a whack of tannins + a couple of threads of dark roastiness.

A lesson in not aging adjunct beers, but also not necessarily better than the regular strength version."
Wide Awake It's Morning,4.32,"2017 vintage

Moving right along from the incredible Maple Bacon Coffee Porter I had last night, we now have the imperial version, with an extra 3.1% abv. Maybe the flavors will integrate even better in this beefier beer. Let’s crack it open and find out

Pours completely pitch black with a finger of light tan head that fades to ring and leaves minimal lacing

Yeah it really is similar to the base beer in the nose, just bolder. I’m picking up on aromas of sweet maple, medium roast coffee, dark chocolate, toffee, smoky bacon, and burnt caramel

It definitely tastes fuller, and in turn less abrasive than its base. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting sweet maple, light roast coffee, cocoa powder, black cherry, salty bacon, and light caramel. The swallow brings notes of maple syrup, smoky bacon, burnt caramel, medium roast coffee, tobacco, brown sugar, and light vanilla

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes mostly dry with a balanced sweetness

This one is also really good, just edging out the base beer. Next up is the barrel aged version, Morning Wood, which I’m very excited to try"

Reviewed: 16 JUNE 2023

A: Pous crystal clear, copper in color, moderate sized bright white head dissipates quickly leaving no lacing. Looks still in the glass’s 4.25

S: Aroma is immediate raspberries, hay and raw wheat. Initially quite floral which then cedes to funky notes of slightly pungent cheese. I can’t say that it smells particularly sour, but there’s some lactic tartness and citrus rind. Quite complex and a wonderful nose. 4.75

T: Taste follows with a big plastic like funk up front, which quickly yields to floral and citrus notes, with big oaky vanilla on the finish that lingers forever. Taste is quite tart and sour but it’s not as puckering as many lambics. The raspberry characters are present but certainly not prominent, not sure to what extent that’s due to the age. 4.5

M/D: Mouthfeel is lighter side of medium bodied with a big but appropriate carbonation and incredible drinkability. I could drink this all day. 5

O: A wonderful beer no doubt. Not sure if it was worth the difficulty in obtaining as I think I prefer Cantillon Rose de Gabrinus when it comes to Raspberry lambics (and I’ve surprisingly found the other easy to get over the years). Regardless, still wonderful and I would have a fridge full of this on the regular if it was readily available. 4.5"

Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,4.25,A little hard to review brews that BA has rated very high. Expectations are too high to start. This beer is a perfect example. No way is it 100 rating. It is quite good but not even in my top 25. Nice golden yellow color with a fruity aroma. Has a nice flavor but a little too carbonated for my taste. Very enjoyable but just not that top level as rated. Solid IPA…that’s it.
Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,4.42,"Poured from 16oz can into my 8th Wonder chalice. Date stamp is very hard to read but I think it was canned on 1/23/24.

Appearance: thoroughly hazy yellow-orange hue with a finger of frothy ivory foam.

Smell: shazam! Citrus, passionfruit, forest fruits, maybe even a little stone fruit character … this thing is juice galore. Woop woop!

Taste: stone fruit and tropical passionfruit / guava are much more to the fore than in the aroma. Soft and sweet with a really lovely juicy, fruity character. Getting close to being too sweet for me, but still really nice.

Mouthfeel: medium body with a good carbonation and creaminess.

Overall: yes, ma’am, that’s a darn good beer."

I don’t buy much Other Half, since by the time it makes it to my area it’s usually a few months old. That being said, Tavour has been getting me back into them lately with relatively fresh cans. Admittedly, I should’ve gotten around to this one sooner since I’ve had it for a few weeks, but I’m excited to try it regardless. Let’s get into it

Pours a cloudy orange gold with 3 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

The nose is vibrant and tropical, but there’s a nice bitter hop character to it as well. I’m picking up on aromas of orange juice, lemon zest, overripe cantaloupe, floral hops, bready malt, gooseberry, dank weed, dried blueberry, and light grass

And it manages to keep up that wonderful balance in taste too thankfully. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting overripe cantaloupe, pineapple juice, bready malt, grassy hops, blueberry candy, dank weed, and light orange zest. The swallow brings notes of orange zest, gooseberry, crackery malt, dank weed, grassy hops, pineapple juice, overripe cantaloupe, and light grapefruit zest

A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a smooth yet crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry and refreshing

Oh yeah, this one is great. Super drinkable for the style with a great balance"
Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,4.64,"I thought I had this one before and loved it. However, that was Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream. And I loved that. But I love this one too.

Hazy pale orange juice with little head and lacing. Hoppy citrusy scents of orange and pineapple, slightly tangy and dank. Taste presents notes of dank, tangy, zesty citrusy notes of pineapple, lemon, and orange. Lighter to medium bodied, very clean, mouth watering, subtle alcohol. An excellent example of the style."
Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,4.84,"Just a simply outstanding beer. Roasty dark malt, strong bittersweet coffee, and a boozy barrel presence. Extremely well balanced with strong flavors. Second barred aged stout I’ve had from Perennial in the last month (Abraxas being the other), and both are among the best beers I’ve ever had."
Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,4.58,"Appearance - The beer was brownish black in appearance with tan bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass.

Smell - The nose went beyond normal coffee, sweetness. I thought I might have detected maple.

Mouthfeel - There was a huge coffee presence in the beer. It was sweet, giving me the impression that I was getting some maple in the profile. The barrel was strong, leaving no doubt that this was barrel aged. It had the right balance and was not hot. The coffee profile lingered.

Mouthfeel - There was a high drinkability factor, since the stout was not overly thick. Still, the profile lingered.

Overall - This beer really hit all the notes for a barrel aged coffee, stout."

Breakfast Stout,4.03,"Note: I am in the process of moving all of my ratings from other beer sites to here, so that all of my ratings are consolidated in one place. The review below is an exact copy of my original RateBeer review from 06/16/2018.


12 oz. bottle.

AROMA: Scents of chocolate, coffee, and caramel.

APPEARANCE: Pours an opaque black with a medium-tan head that dissipates slowly.

TASTE: Medium-sweet with flavors of dark coffee, chocolate, and cream

PALATE: Full-bodied, creamy texture, with average carbonation. Finish is subtle coffee bitterness that slowly wanes.

OVERALL: It's dark, it's sweet, it's creamy, and it's coffee flavored! What's not to like? However, it does tend to be on the sweet side, but not quite to the point of being cloying (although, admittedly, it is walking a fine line here). If you like stouts and you like coffee, then you can't go wrong with this one."
Breakfast Stout,3.93,"Looks great, smells appetizing, good stout but just too much chocolate for me."
Breakfast Stout,5.0,Omg
Breakfast Stout,3.5,"I sure was looking forward to drinking this beer because of the glowing reviews. Unfortunately this beer isn't for me -- and I love stouts and porters too! I guess I ""should've known"" because I am not a coffee beer fan. I don’t like coffee in my ice-cream or in my beer.

The beer itself tastes like a adjunct stout with added coffee and roasted dark chocolate. It mostly taste of molasses though. Sorta reminds me of a cup of shoefly pie in a glass. It tastes rich and hearty and probably has a equivalent of a loaf of bread in it.... but I've had much better ""imperial"" stouts from other brands which didn't need to adjunct and add coffee to the beer.

If you like coffee in your beer then go for it. If you want a ""normal"" stout then stay away."
Breakfast Stout,3.83,"From the tap at stout nyc in fi-di:
Balanced smoke, coffee, dark choc... Maybe the most well balanced, well proportioned beer i've ever had. Hard to fathom how balanced it is.
However, this is too carbonated for my taste, and far too bitter. I will take many an irish dry stout over this beer any day. I feel this beer has been a tad overhyped. For the price, i know it is."
Breakfast Stout,4.35,Quite something as stouts go . . Tho' might be considered a bit too sweet ?? Dairy Queen meets a Stout : )
The Greenest Green,4.53,"Appearance - It is not green, dank orange color with carbonation largely obscured.

Smell - The nose had orange and a bit of dankness.

Taste - It did taste green. There was loads of tropical fruit, particularly pineapple. It also had some qualities of orange juice. The pleasant bitter finish put it over the top for me.

Mouthfeel - There was some serious viscosity in this one.

Overall - The bitterness made this one enjoyable for me."
The Greenest Green,4.63,"From a 16oz can dated 6/18/24 into a 20oz ""pint"" glass. Can message: ""Let's go Celtics!""

Pours an opaque orangish yellow with just a little over one finger of white head. Excellent retention and lacing.

Big pineapple, mango and citrus on the crack of the can. Mainly oranges and a touch of earth in the glass-not nearly as strong the can opening.

Nice punch of juice up front in the mouth then strong earthy, piney bitterness. Hint of alcohol on the tail end.

Full-bodied but soft, creamy mouthfeel with a dry-ish finish. Low to medium carbonation. Bitter aftertaste.

Knocked this one out of the park."
The Greenest Green,4.63,"From a five-week-old can, pours a densely hazy yellow-orange. Big, towering head of dense white foam holds its shape an inch above the glass. I'm getting mainly papaya and mango on the nose, with just the slightest hint of green herbs and dank. Smooth, rich feel. Such a great beer."
The Greenest Green,4.63,"Is it possible that this iteration of Green is actually bigger and greener than its ancestors?

The aroma blasts into the air as soon as the can is cracked - pine, tropical fruits and an abundance of citrus met my nose immediately.

Tropical citrus flavors are also upfront but they are backed with some nice earthy and dank notes. The finish is plenty bitter with a resiny mouthfeel."
The Greenest Green,4.4,"Sweet tropical hoppy, very malty, earthy-hoppy, and an orange citrus nose on this one! Taste follows with a malty-sweet, earthy-citrus hoppy bitter finish. This one is a little better balanced between the maltiness and the hop expression. Tasty!"
The Greenest Green,4.5,Rating imported from Untappd.
The Greenest Green,4.46,"Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. It's so green Dec 4th 2023.

Turbid with a bit of a hinting shiny body, but fast carbonated with murky yellowish tinge. Classic bright solid white cap, four to three fingers thick and rich and not budging on the glass at all.

Very interesting hop aroma. Spicy and thick, hints slightly dank and pungent with mushy pineapple and strangely as well with what seems like pickle brine. Large amounts of earth and soily sweetness that hits like a smokey wallop.

Delicious palate. Chewy tasting, with a flavor that feels like mint chewing gum and tropical hop richness. Minty warm, with pungent aromas on the palate hinting pineapple and vanilla, giving a touch of pina colada like quality. Minty and nice soft bitterness that melds wonderfully on the finish. Reminds me somewhat of ice cream in flavor with the texture.

Quite a fascinating IPA. Kind of wish the fruit character was a little more pronounced and dominant, but there is little to complain about here."

§ucaba,4.2,"2014 vintage courtesy of @2beerdogs.

Color on the pour is a light amber that settles into a darker shade once in the glass. Excellent clarity and legs. Minimal short-lived off-white head. Good looking beer.

Aroma is fantastic with an excellent balance of caramel, toffee and fruit with a faint marmalade background. It's very rich, bursts from the glass, and smells amazing.

Plenty of sweet malts on the tongue. Toffee & molasses with fig and other fruits. Almost zero bitterness. Very tasty. Smooth as velvet with plenty of alcohol warming.

Overall, excellent beer."

§ucaba,4.32,"2023 vintage

I’m surprised it’s taken me so long to try this legendary yet seemingly accessible beer. I’ve had this marked as a want for almost as long as I’ve been on BA and I’m hyped to finally try it. Let’s pop it open and find out what it’s all about

Pours a cloudy medium reddish brown with a finger of soapy light beige head that fades to a ring and leaves decent lacing

The nose is quite sweet but really well balanced despite that. I’m picking up on aromas of brown sugar, molasses, sweet bourbon, toasted oak, honey, toasted walnut, vanilla bean, red grape, burnt caramel, and baked apple

In taste it’s unfortunately a bit sweeter, but it’s still pretty good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting brown sugar, sweet bourbon, raisin, vanilla bean, molasses, smooth oak, pear skin, cocoa powder, red grape, and light caramel. The swallow brings notes of sweet bourbon, molasses, brown sugar, roasted peanut, red grape, baked apple, vanilla bean, burnt caramel, and smooth oak

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick beer with some heat. Finishes mostly dry despite the sweetness

I like this, but I do think it’s a bit overhyped for what it is. I have another bottle that I’ll probably cellar for a few years"
§ucaba,4.83,"Of the barrel aged Barleywines I've had this is easily the best. Mostly because of mouthfeel. Nice and rich. Great bourbon barrel aroma and taste. And, a nicely balanced barleywine flavor. 2018 Vintage."
§ucaba,4.32,"2018 Vintage, sipped on March 24, 2023 in a stout snifter glass.

Dark brown with deep red highlights. A near 1f cap appears briefly before settling to a thick rim film. A few spots of lacing, surprisingly.

Oak aged bourbon and booze aroma up front. Toasted dark bread malts, chocolate, and caramel.

Flavors of bourbon soaked toast and malt, vanilla, dark chocolate, and a touch of cherry wine.

Big and boozy body, yet quite smooth. There’s a light touch of carbonation and the dark chocolate slips in the finish.

An incredibly well aged Barley Wine Ale. A nice tug of war between strong booze and mellow sips."

Residual bourbon, caramel left on the palate."

2018 vintage
Drank January ‘23

Caramel brown with a half inch of short lived tan foam. Some suspended sediment from the second pour. Malty sweet aroma, caramel, bread, dark fruit and some mild alcohol. Tastes much the same, with the addition of toffee/molasses type sweetness and a touch of metallic tang. It is sweet but a clean bitter finish keeps the sweetness well in check. Medium body, low carination, smooth and soft closing with a warm alcohol bite.

This has held up well. But the BA character is gone and I’m guessing some of the hop flavor has disappeared but oxidative flavor, really only a small metallic tang, is low. Drinks easy considering the high ABV."
Art,4.54,"Mostly clear, vibrantly glistening yellow-gold with a short but somewhat well-retaining white head clinging in a doily ridge.

It's funkier than I imagined, with a uniquely soft brie that fills the nose before accenting touches of buttery white wine and nutty oak develop.

The palate crisps it up with tart pear and slightly overripe and dried apricot while toastier oak develops in a way that somehow conjures up honey representations.

And so the pursuit comes to a conclusion, in a way such that, for me, elucidates how the biggest names in Hill's wine barrel aged saison collection are not the pinnacle in their catalogue, while still clearly have contributed to some beautiful blends, like Clover, as well as honed their experience in pursuing other expressions, like Samuel, Work's of Love (Monk's Café, Cigar City), and more.

I'm just glad I no longer have to stress over which organ I'll need to give up in order to try this sucker."
Art,4.86,"Batch 6. Probably my number one want, and what a treat to check if off up at the source. Wonderfully complex from aroma through the finish -- bit of a wild funk character, bit of white wine fruitiness, bit of drying oak, bit of honey sweetness, bit of herbal hops, and a bit of... English muffin? Just fantastic all around. This may be the best regularly available beer in the world

98/100"
Art,4.49,"A: The decanter tinges vermilion on the initial impact, which transfers to a vivid – metallic – orange. That luminosity tops a deep saffron base with a pastel orange hue, as gamboge tones streak throughout. Proportionately, an askew cap that comes to a vista white inch, while steadily downsizing to the ½ in, where the palette succumbs a snow drift highlight. The configuration has the hydrophobic polypeptides & bitter acids to modestly cling, when retreating to the ¼ in. At this point, a latticework with a residual nuance to dimly stick, as the retention retains an enacting solidity. Albeit, shy on the aesthetic decree, seeing the descending collar to the minute. The layouts have a transparency upon the transfers, which have an opulent appeal early on, while a circuitous convention develops amid the pressing radiations

S: A density set to esters, as they constantly web around the oak casks, while the grain bill pitches a smart rusticity. There is an isoamyl octanoate innuendo near the persuasive peach accompaniments, which takes a Torani Syrup form. In this respect, a softly tart & fuzzy recording that’s lightly backed, by the oak tannin exchanges, while the hop effect lends a floral regularity. The phenolic compounds gradually characterize on cobwebs, aside a ripened mustiness, given the vintage works over the decant. However, a narrow presentation on the inaugurating course, as the directive is more symphonic to the seeds and skins above the alluding crops. The advancements have a stronger denotation on the aged strains with a grain bill that ties in pit + trench silos, while maintaining a profitable presence on esters. Markedly, a harmonization amongst the ranching & pastoral foregrounds to the milder fruits ascribing pears, berries, and apricots. Moreover, an undercroft ease on the °F upticks, while a dry Torrontés similitude dispatches, besides the barrel aldehydes. The cessations retain an earthed ruralism against the – loitering – eugenol structures, beyond the leathery tannin constitutes

T: Fermentable complexities with a soft cask neatness, which traits ethyl acetates to porous oak codas. Namely, an oxidized kindliness that has a solvent growth under fresh clingstone peaches, which impute seedy connotations per the inferred pits. The French oak barrel offers mild spices to complex polymers, where phenolic aldehydes pitch vanillin. Meanwhile, malt backs the bready accounts with Dorset knobs & pie crusts, as hops back a longleaf pine essence, while ketones casually mingle. Chiefly, an inducement on raspberry ketones alongside strawberries & melons, before connoting emerald drop pluots. A buildout on fleshed fruit to palm syrup, as catacomb dust delicately descends on Golden Silk Spiders. Coupled with, cattle yard atmospheres to leathery tannins, as a transferred aridity elevates above the rustic granularities. The timing to weather – over the course – reverberates that inaugurating solvency thru an Oloroso Sherry implementation, which offers an oxidative nuttiness to exotic thickets. On the rear side, a perceptible murmur on cloves & nutmeg, while guaiacols quietly coat the codicils over smoke, as polyphenol compounds dictate

M: There is a passing rain to flagstone texture, from a minerality component that later transcends on seafronts. The surface is soft with calm acidic natures, given the modest vivacities, which attenuate steadily. In consequence, a dry formation that benefits over the cask scriptures, when depicting the hydrolysable substances

O: Yeast grandiosities that are perceptively backed across the bitter – earthy – hop effects, while phenolic companions lurk. On balance, a sensitive malt mannerism with a loyal intention to not annihilate the course, as the French oak barrels impress. The timetables are advantageous to the vintage over an improved dryness, from cut sugars to cranked up/interconnected esters"

Grey Monday,4.71,"Review: 2200
Name: Grey Monday
Brewery: The Bruery
Location: Placentia, CA
Style: Double Barrel Imperial Barrel Aged Stout
ABV: 20.8%
Canned: 2019
Date: 12 Sept 2024
I have reached 2200 reviews/beers. I never thought I would get over 1000 reviews when I started this. I am looking forward to the next 100 until it comes time for 5000 reviews. For this milestone, I chose a behemoth, Grey Monday, from 2019. The name 'Grey Monday' is a nod to the intense, complex flavors of this beer, which make it a perfect choice for a contemplative, rainy day. I was using a tulip glass and served the beer at 50 degrees. The pour created a frothy, airy, one-fingered, light tan head with poor retention. The semi-quick retention left no lacing on the glass. The color is inky black and opaque, charting at SRM 38. This beer is beautiful; I am okay with the quick dissipation because of the 20.8 ABV.
Bringing the glass to my nose, I'm greeted by a symphony of aromas. The massive oak barrel, the intense bourbon, the nutty, and chocolate notes all dance together. Nosing the glass again, I pick up on the subtler hints of coffee, tobacco, char, earthy tones, alcohol, molasses, raisins, figs, caramel, toffee, Maillard, burnt sugar, nutty, vanilla, light char, and oranges. This beer is a sensory adventure, with each aroma adding a new layer to its complexity.
The first sip of Grey Monday is a revelation. The flavors burst forth, starting with a massive nuttiness that's a perfect blend of chocolate, coffee, bourbon, char, and oak. It's like a delicious nut butter mixed with fine chocolate, reminiscent of Nutella but with a sophisticated twist. As the beer's flavor develop on the palate toffee, caramel, molasses, char, tobacco, vanilla, and earthy notes. The double barrel created a huge complex depth to the beer with oak, bourbon, char, and caramel notes. This beer is a unique experience, a journey of flavors that keeps you returning for more.
I was expecting this chewy mouthfeel, but it was more than that. The beer coats your tongue and palate, leaving a rich, dense finish that warms you from the inside. The body is heavy and has medium carbonation, adding to the overall luxurious mouthfeel.
I am grateful that Grey Monday wasn't overly heavy and chewy, as I had expected. The beer's high ABV didn't make it too hot, and I loved the expressive nuttiness. The barrel aging was just right, not overpowering the other flavors. I'm not sure how they achieved this balance, where I'm not only sipping on wood. This is truly an enjoyable Stout, especially on a chilly, damp Idaho evening."
Grey Monday,4.29,"750 ml bottle into a snifter. Bottled 5/7/21, had 6/22/24.

Pours near black and opaque, with a brief head and no lacing. Aromas of roasted malt, chocolate, vanilla, oak, some bourbon, some hazelnut when warmed. Flavors of bourbon- strong as it warms, roasted malt, chocolate, some oak, some hazelnut, light vanilla. Smooth, a very good full body, appropriately carbonated.

The Black Tuesday base is great. The hazelnuts show, but not as expected/desired. Maybe they’ve faded from age, but maybe not. Still, it’s pretty solid overall, and very enjoyable.

Grey Monday,3.96,"2024-08-04
750ml capped/waxed bottle served in a small Hoppin' Frog snulip. 2018 Edition, handed to me by @2beerdogs.


Pours dark brown, not as dark as I expected, nearly still, basically no head. Smell is mild alcohol up front, tons of chocolate, some coffee and vanilla.

Taste is not as boozy as I was afraid, though definitely boozy. I get vanilla and spice before chocolate and plums. Label says hazelnut, but I think that specific flavor is either lost to time or drowned out by the booze, vanilla, and char.

Mouthfeel is lighter than expected, only medium bodied, and has a bit of a dry texture which really surprises me. Overall, this is interesting and good, and will be very interesting as it warms up over the next couple hours while I sip on it."
Grey Monday,4.31,"Bottle pour - dark as night with short, quickly dissipating khaki head leaving a ring of tiny bubbles. Nose is sweet with cocoa and molasses, boozy barrel wood and hints of nuts. Taste follows more or less, definitely getting alcohol creep that lingers on the finish. A cold weather sipper."
Grey Monday,4.31,"2021 vintage

I’m an absolute sucker for hazelnuts in a Stout, and when I see that The Bruery has one, it’s an instant buy. Plus it’s also another top 250 list tick. This is a big ass bottle that I’ll likely be attacking all night so let’s stop wasting time and get right into it

Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of light tan head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

Right off the jump, there isn’t much hazelnut present in the nose, but it’s still interesting nonetheless. I’m picking up on aromas of molasses, earthy bourbon, peat smoke, sea salt, cocoa powder, toasted hazelnut, dry oak, light vanilla, and raisin

The hazelnuts definitely express a bit more in taste, though they still aren’t exactly at the forefront. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting cocoa powder, earthy bourbon, toasted hazelnut, toasted oak, black cherry, burnt caramel, vanilla, sea salt, and smoky tobacco. The swallow brings notes of dark chocolate, earthy bourbon, toasted hazelnut, sea salt, peat smoke, sea salt, molasses, dry oak, burnt caramel, and light vanilla

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes mostly dry and drinks significantly below its abv. Like literally less than half and that’s easily the most impressive part of this one

I struggle with this one. It’s definitely not top 250 material, and the adjunct isn’t really the star, but on the other hand it’s (dangerously) drinkable and pretty unique. Worth a shot for sure"
Grey Monday,4.2,"750mL bottle, 2021 edition sent to new Society members under their new nationwide shipping policy. Very little difference from the base Black Tuesday, if I'm honest, having had regular BT many times but this being my first Grey Monday. That means it's excellent, but the hazelnut treatment is pretty muted at this point (if it was ever more prominent), yielding a slight generic nuttiness with a touch of additional sweetness. It's not Nutella, that's for sure. It also suffers the same shortcomings of the standard BT, being very thin on mouthfeel for the ultra-high ABV and pretty hot on bourbon heat once it warms up a bit."
Grey Monday,3.76,"Pours a very dark brown though with moderate light clarity on the edges. Fizzy cola head that quickly dissipates to a thin ring. Nose has a hint of hazelnuts right off the bat before giving way to big waves of whiskey and rum, molasses, dark soy sauce, barley, oyster sauce, and vanilla. Flavor is a little tough to place. Heat - both warming booze and sharp ethanol - pop right away. There's significant salinity that's different from Black Tuesday - less deep, blackstrap molasses, more brackish sea spray or even oysters. Malts, soy sauce, black licorice are there, but with less intensity than BT. The nuts come forward as it warms, and though it's hard to definitively place hazelnuts, they would be a guess along with peanuts and hazelnuts - definitely nothing too fatty like a walnut. Mouthfeel is remarkably thin for this kind of beer (I'd call it ""moderate""), especially when compared to BT or a BCBS. That's not bad per se, but I think the feel contributes to the overall heat and sharpness. This was interesting - though I'm not sure I'd be keen to shell out for another bottle."
Lou Pepe - Gueuze,4.48,"A - Vibrant deep cherry red color with dense creamy, pink foam.

S - Intense, complex tart cherry twang on the nose.

T - Tart complex cherry from start to finish, nice lingering tart cherry.

M - Medium body with light carbonation.

O - I'm not a fan of Sours but this is fantastic and highly recommended."
Lou Pepe - Gueuze,4.05,"Look - Absolutely love the look. organish copper with one great head and rimming/lacing that keeps on keeping on
Smell - grainy slight citrus tart
Taste - about the same
Feel - medium body light carb

Society & Solitude #6,4.9,"#156, good stuff!"
Society & Solitude #6,4.25,"Had a single draft at the Mule Bar in Winooski for eight dollars. My eighth brew reviewed from these guys. Very good, but not one of their best beers."
Montmorency Vs Balaton,4.6,"I remember having Astrial Rubicite years ago, swearing then that I would someday try JK's other famed beer M vs B. Now it is finally here! Ruby red pour with a small eggshell white head that eventually settle into surface islands. Smell is exactly what was promised: sour cherries and classic JK farmhouse yeast, barnyard funk, and a touch of lemon peel all with a kiss of vanilla. Taste switches the vanilla and lemon intensities, funk is milder but now get some hay, genera supporting red fruits, and a touch of earth. The best new world take of this belgian classic I have had in a long time. Feel is tart, mildly acidic but more so funky, medium bodied and very smooth in a cooling fashion"
Montmorency Vs Balaton,4.4,"Bout #8, bottled May 2023

Shortly after having the legendary Atrial Rubicite for review #1900, I have another highly acclaimed Wild Ale from Jester King for tonight. They have a knack for fruited Wild Ales, so I'm betting that this one will be a home run. Let's pop it open and see what it's all about

Pours an opaque reddish purple with a finger of pinkish white head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

The nose is actually rather subdued surprisingly. I'm picking up on aromas of tart cherry, lemon juice, sharp oak, brown sugar, vanilla, red wine vinegar, and graham cracker

Things liven up much more in taste, amping up both the tartness and the sweetness. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting tart cherry, sharp oak, cranberry, brown sugar, tannic red wine, wet hay, lemon zest, old leather, and light raspberry. The swallow brings notes of tart cherry, graham cracker, tannic red wine, sharp oak, old leather, toasted walnut, vanilla, jammy raspberry, lemon juice, and wildflower honey

A light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp beer. Finishes mostly dry and refreshing

Another winner from Jester King to absolutely nobody's surprise. Dammit, all this Jester King lately is tempting me to visit the brewery some day"
Montmorency Vs Balaton,4.55,"750ml green bottle. Date on label describes this as 'BOUT #8 - MAY 2023'.
Cherry red colored body. Very brief head, which disappears within a few seconds. Rising bubbles try to make a ring. No lacing.
Aroma of sour funk (leather) and oak, with a background of tart cherries.
Taste is layered for both depth and length. Initial cherry flavor is rather sweet but then turns tart. Oak throughout. Earthy funk. Brief appearance of spice, with a longer interval of vanilla. Sweet and tart in the aftertaste, which fades away rather slowly.
Medium mouth feel, with a touch of syrup. Some drying in the finish but not a tooth scraper.
The cherries taste really fresh and expand the flavors beyond the base sour ale. Bright red appearance, full nose, and a range of flavors make this one to savor. Presents a wide palate of experience but so well balanced and no extremes."
V.S.O.R. Select,4.81,"It's been a while since I had a new ""amazing"" beer. This is one of them. Complex flavors that evolve over time. This is a sipper because a taste of this cannot be fully appreciated quickly. Just WOW! Not really boozy...more intoxicating in flavor, aroma and mouthfeel. I could list a lot of flavors like caramel, rye, cognac, dark fruit. But it is the blend that is key.

This is sold in 12oz cans. Don't consider its price without converting to a bomber of this quality. And feel lucky if you find one."
Leaner,4.29,"Appearance - The beer was golden orange color with visible carbonation.

Smell - The nose was vinegary, with notes of peach.

Taste - The taste profile was vinegary at the front. There were notes of peach and green apple. It was highly acidic, chipping away at my tooth enamel. There were notes of fresh cut grass before the funk emerged at the finish.

Mouthfeel - Carbonation was aggressive. The body had staying power.

Overall - The beer drank more like a kettle sour than a saison."
Leaner,4.52,"Look - Hazy Orangish copper with a really nice white head and rimming and slight lacing
Smell -easy peach tart
Taste -really nice slightly tart peach and wood
Feel -medium body and creamy
Overall - love it"
Appervation,4.5,"375ml bottle at share.Black pour, ring of brown head. Aroma is roasty malts, coffee, chocolate. Taste is roasty and bitter, mildly sweet chcocolate and a healthy dose of ABV."
Appervation,4.54,"On draft at Jackie O's on 4th in Columbus - nice rich chocolate flavor - wish they hadn't been serving this so cold, but it was far better as it warmed. Black with a slight brown head - great barrel but very balanced - you can taste the SP influence in this beer. Chewy finish. Very very solid BA stout."
Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,4.66,Delicious DIPA! Taste follows the nose. Tropical delight.
Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,4.42,"Poured from 16oz can into a tulip. Canned 2/16/24.

Appearance: medium golden-yellow hue with plenty of haze and a finger of frothy ivory foam.

Smell: sweet malt with an excellent tropical, fruity, juicy, orange-Julius-ey aroma. I am enticed, intrigued, and enraptured.

Taste: a little bit earthier and danker than the aroma, but still with an excellent tropical fruit character. Really, really, good.

Mouthfeel: medium body with a good carbonation and creaminess.

Overall: while there is some complexity to this beer, it doesn't have the depth, say, of a rich barleywine or Belgian quad. That said, the depth this beer possesses is in a flavor zone that really appeals to me. Flavor Flav says don't believe the hype, but in this case, I think it's warranted. Outstanding beer."
Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,4.03,"Canned 11/16/23 (2 months ago)

Appearance: Pours a nearly completely hazy (10% clarity) medium golden color with a strong white head. SRM of 7. (4.00)

Aroma: Strong aromas of orange citrus, tropical pineapple, some mango and melon underneath.

Flavor: Strong flavors of orange citrus, tangerine, tropical pineapple with some sweet melon and apricot underneath. Juicy and resinous. Finishes sweet.

Feel: Heavier-bodied, strong, carbonation, finishes, smooth and sweet. Hides the ABV well.

Compared to Other Half DDH Southern Hopalistic 1/2024: Pours brighter. similar head. Milder aromas. More tangerine, resinous mango and apricot. Less lime, lemon citrus, and green grape/melon. Juicier and sweeter.

to Drekker Goon Platoon 2/2024: Pours simliar, milder aromas. More tangerine, pineapple, resinous pine and mango. Less orange, guava, kiwi, strawberry. Similar sweetness, but more pine.

Overall: Rated World-Class on BeerAdvocate. Large and sweet. Has more tangerine, mango, and apricot flavors. Hides the ABV well. Pretty good, actually very good. Pretty standard for Other Half Though in my opinion."
Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,4.46,"Canned on: 11-16-23

A - Opaque medium golden tan color with very dense, bright white sticky foam and lacing. The whiteness sticks on the sides of the glass like cotton candy.

S - Peach, spicy fruit rind, apricot, spicy pineapple, and tangerine. Overall aroma is dank and spicy.

T - No surprise this falls in line with the aroma - dank, fruity, and spicy from start to finish. Peach, apricot, papaya, tropical fruit, and spicy citrus with pineapple while finishing on the sweeter side.

M - Big medium body, pillowy soft, and chewy. There's some slight warming in the back of the throat.

O - This shah is memorable, fantastic, and worth seeking out. Recommended."
Yellow Bus,4.6,2020 version. Thank you Dustin! Amazing beer.
Yellow Bus,4.5,"2020 remake version, not the OG white whale. Never having tasted the original I have no comparison but not a darn thing wrong with this. Juicy ripe peaches for days balanced nicely by the sourness."
Yellow Bus,4.53,"Appearance: Pours a somewhat hazy golden color with a one finger head that fades to a collar; squiggles of lacing

Smell: Barnyard funk and tart peach with a floral, peach blossom element; very oaky

Taste: Vinous peach with barnyard funk and a floral aspect; oaky and tart, through the middle, with a dry, somewhat sour finish

Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate to high carbonation; puckery

Overall: A delightful sour with all the elements in perfect harmony"
Midnight Still,4.9,"#200, great beer!"
Midnight Still,4.53,2020 version poured from a bottle into a snifter. This is nicely thick with a strong fudge flavor.
Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.5,"From a bottle. Pours a dark rich brown color with an inch plus of thick creamy tan foam. Smells of caramel, toffee, and dark fruit; no hops. The flavor follows the smell: sweet, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, also no hops. The body is medium-light. Very quaffable."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.17,"Generally dark caramel in color, but towards the thinner bottom of the glass more light is able to shine through and there's an almost birch beer like appearance. Loads of foamy tan head with excellent retention and good lacing. Overall, a very attractive beer.

Caramel vibes on the nose, with no hops present. Taste mostly follows...lots of sweet malts....caramel & toffee. Nice dry finish, but no hop bite. Medium-light bodied and very smooth and clean.

Overall, excellent beer."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.41,"Finally got to try this much talked about beer last night and it definitely lived up to the hype. I've never tasted something so complex and layered. Initial impression when you open up the bottle and pour it is the striking caramel color (which might lead you into thinking it's a stout but the colour is lighter than a stout as you can notice when you hold it up against a light) along with strong aromas of spice and alcohol and hints of chocolate. It also has a nice foam that lasts for a long time.

When you first taste it you might be taken aback by how undeniably smooth it is and how well the alcohol is masked in the sip. At 11% alcohol, you might feel that it will taste of that and nothing else but you'd be wrong. Alcohol is one of the last things you'll taste in this beer. Initially you'll taste coffee and spice along with a gentle, soothing sweetness that pleasantly compliments that stringent alcohol taste and in the finish you get a nice bitterness that is generally associated with beers. But the finish is not where this beer stops testing your senses. You'll feel warmth coursing through your body as this drink makes its way to your stomach where once it reaches you'll feel more pleasant warmth, a warmth that is comparable to the one felt while feasting on a soup or a stew.

It's definitely a high quality and one of a kind beer that should be tried by every person interested in beer. It's a strong and complex tasting beer that is good to drink in winters and that too every once a while. I cannot see myself drinking this every other week, this is a once a two-three month kind of beer for me, not just due to the price but also due to the fact that its so much to take in. This is the dark elixir that I imagine is drunk by royals in Game of Thrones."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,5.0,I almost never rate anything perfect because that means I can never do better. Like my lifelong beer quest is at its apex and it is all downhill from here. But having been tasting and rating beer for around forty years I can say that Rochefort 10 is the world's best beer. And that includes Westy 12. Rochefort has a certain malty thickness to it that I don't get from Westy. I just love the stuff. World's best. What else can I say beyond that?
Trappistes Rochefort 10,3.93,Too much alcohol. Astringent and bitter. It does taste of cola and chocolate. An absurd amount of head and carbonation. Overall not as good as I would expect.
Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.42,"Note: I am in the process of moving all of my ratings from other beer sites to here, so that all of my ratings are consolidated in one place. The review below is an exact copy of my original RateBeer review from 02/25/2013.


330 ml (11.2 oz.) bottle. Pours a dark, cola brown. In fact, it looks just like Coca-cola. Has a light-brown head that dissipates quickly. Aromas of chocolate, caramel, and raisins. Taste is, WOW! Lightly-sweet, but not overly so, with flavors of cola, plum, and another fruit that I can’t quite put my finger on. Has a medium body and texture. Carbonation is pretty lively. Finish is smooth and long with hints of brown sugar.

This is one fine beer. The only thing I might be inclined to change would be to make it a little fuller in body."
Pseudo Sue,4.14,"I purchased this one at Plonk in Fyshwick in January 2024 and finally drank it in August of that year.

L: The beer is hazy to the point of opaque with a light sunset yellow hue in the glass. There's a frothy, bright-white, long-lasting head. A multitude of bubbles can be seen along the edges of the glass. If not for the head, at a distance, I'd have thought I was drinking fruit juice.

S: The aroma is the usual hazy pale ale tropical, slightly dank, citrus melange, with pineapple, mango and guava standing out.

T: The taste, as is often the case with these beers, closely mirrors the nose, with an alcoholic fruit punch vibe. Pine, mango, and orange come to the fore, but I could pick a heap of other fruits if I thought long and hard enough. There's warmth on the way down, and given that the beer is only 5.8% ABV, I'm assuming that's the hop load talking. There's the slightest bite of shampoo in the aftertaste, but it enhances the overall experience rather than detracts.

M: The mouthfeel is full and soft, like a hazy should be, and carbonation is mild and sherbety.

O: This is very nice, and it's a credit to the brewer that I'm drinking it on the other side of the world eight months after I bought it, and there's still a vigorous, tropical aroma and hoppy bite on the swallow.

Cheers!
#591"
Pseudo Sue,3.7,"Just a fine IPA, nothing special. Tastes basically like a Surly, which isn’t a diss. La Doña, Pliny, most Oliphants, Dreamyard, and even Foggy Geezer are tastier."
Pseudo Sue,4.43,"Arguably the best pale ale I've had in my life. Beautiful lacing, gorgeous citrusy bouquet that leads into a very drinkable beer with pleasant mouthfeel and a wonderful hoppiness. I don't usually like hoppiness this much but this hoppiness turned into happiness for me."
Pseudo Sue,4.51,"The flavors a citrus, pine resin, grapefruit with some flora hop notes. The mouthfeel has moderate to high carbonation with a medium body and clean finish. Excellent!"
Pseudo Sue,4.16,Incredible beer. Very drinkable. Great tasting notes and mouthfeel. This is just what a NEIPA should be.
Pseudo Sue,4.64,My favorite “American Pale ale”
Pseudo Sue,4.25,"I understand that the world thinks this is a practically perfect Citra ale - and I do not necessarily disagree, but to rate it as 99 is over-doing it a bit! First of all, this is not a pale ale, it is an NEIPA! And as that I rated it accordingly above - I couldn't rate it as a pale ale because that's not what it is. It is a lovely beer but I find that after a pint I wouldn't be able to drink more because the sweet aftertaste of the ale is somehow cloying, can't describe it any better than that."
Abrasive Ale,4.31,"Not quite a clear golden color, soapy white head and some greaat lacing. Nose says fruit, citrus, maybe some mango. Nice bitter finish but smooth. Really nice beer, don't see much Surly here."
Abrasive Ale,4.43,"A - Pours out a hazy copper-orange color, super fluffy off-white head, persistent, with lots of small gauge bubble lacing.

S - Strong hit of pine and citrus in the nose, some resin and Citra-brand funk on the tail end.

T - Lovely blast of lemony citrus in the front, an undercurrent of grapefruit comes forward with juicy maltiness through the middle, pepper spice and pith coming forward to a sharp, assertive bitterness in the finish.

M - Super easy to drink, smooth and clean, with moderate weight and an ABV completely hidden, closing with enough dryness to invite immediate return for more.

O - I'd heard about this one for years, but just had never had a chance to get Abrasive until I moved here. Glad to make its acquaintance. I'll be picking this one up again when I get the chance."
Abrasive Ale,4.35,"16-oz can into nonic pint glass

A - cloudy body of golden amber under a finger of off white foam

S - floral, citrus, pine, sweetness

T - big citrus (mainly pink grapefruit), bitter floral notes, a little pine, peppery spice, quite fruity, heavy malt backbone (but the bitterness never lets up); bitter, complex, and enjoyable!

M - bitterness bites all the way through, smooth full body, average carbonation

O - an excellent DIPA from Surly!"
Abrasive Ale,4.4,"(16 oz can, canned on 11/18/22, F5670; purchased 4-pack off shelf at Shangy's... poured into a fat tulip)

L: slightly-hazy medium amber-colored liquid; not a huge head on the pour, but it's tight with a frayed cotton contour... only holds a thin collar, thin misty cap; does leave a big band of lace oppo of sip spot

S: very floral initial pop (rosewater), followed by some fleshy orange pulp, lemon/grapefruit zest, background hint of pine... a little honeyish malt wants to poke through... gummy orange slices... only a soft essence of alcohol... excellent overall intensity

T: citrus kiss, but a rush of florality right behind it... the aftertaste is spicy, with a green bitterness that slowly swells... certainly a big malty base, with a muffin/cakey quality, but it's sodden with hop resins... vague dried pale-colored fruit (apricot, sultana) slowly creeps into the aftertaste, while the residual bitterness grows some peppery hair to it... the volume on the bitterness just keeps increasing, speakers cracking and shaking; hop artifacts emerge

F: its bitter bite takes hold on the tongue, mildly intensified by the ethanol, which sets and singes (and yet cools?!) a touch near the back of the palate... its body and resins make for a silky lusciousness up front, giving way to a growing heat; soft carbonation

O: why did this take so long to be released out east here(?), especially considering Furious had been here for years now; this was the first Surly beer I ever heard of c. 2011 (though Darkness and Bender weren't far behind)... I am going to try the next can in a pint, which they're website suggests is the preferred vessel... aggressive and comforting (2081)"
Abrasive Ale,4.85,"I am so happy to have finally found this locally (PA) after searching for it for years. It did not disappoint. While the can is over a couple of months old, the ale still tasted very fresh. I rate it as having a NE flavor profile while having a west coast appearance. It is translucent and golden, but definitely not cloudy. The head was white and not too foamy. The aromas came in waves of sweet fruit. The flavor came in waves and it seemed each one was a different type of tropical fruit. What a fantastic drinking experience. The only downside was the $5 price tag, but that would be a bargain in a tavern."
Abrasive Ale,4.29,"Canned 11/7/22 (1 month ago)

Appearance: Pours a slightly cloudy (80% clarity) medium orange color with a strong white head. SRM of 9. (4.00)

Aroma: Strong aromas of rich grapefruit, tropical mango and melon. Resinous, earthy, and tropical. Some tropical peach evolves as it warms. (4.25)

Flavor: Flavors follow the nose with strong tropical grapefruit, pineaple, mango/melon with a sweet peach undertone. A moderate balance of sweet and smooth caramel balanced by bitter pine notes. (4.25)

Feel: Heavier bodied, strong carbonation and finishes sweet, but surprisingly clean and drinkable on the palate. (4.25)

Compared to Revolution Anti-Hero IPA 12/2022: Pours lighter, stronger aromas. More juicy grapefruit, tropical pineapple, melon, and peaches. Less resinous nectarine and syrup. Juicier, but also more balanced with pine bitterness. Winner: Surly

Compared to Surly Axe Man 2/2023: Pours darker, hazier. Stronger aromas. More sweet and juicy tangerine and peach. Less dank berry and pine notes.
11/2023: Pours darker, more rich and tropical flavors. More dank and bitter. Heavier, but more flavor overall.

Compared to Great Lakes Ancient Arctic 12/2023: Pours hazier, milder head. Stronger aromas. More dank grapefruit, orange, pine, melon. Less sweet overripe grapefruit, orange, and fruit punch. More bitterness and flavor.

Overall: Wow a surprisingly fantastic IPA here. Grapefruit, tropical pineapple, mango/melon, and peach flavors. Juicy with enough pine and grapefruit citrus rind to balance. Beldns NEIPA juicy flavors with west-coast body and mouthfeel. Sort of reminds me of Half Acres IPA blends and not unlike Axe Man in many ways. I hate imperial IPAs as the alcohol and sweet malts ruin the hop flavors and IPA bitterness nearly every time. This one may be the exception. It's has big juicy orange and tropical melon/berry flavors with a resinous pine bitterness off the end. Sweet, but nicely balanced by bitterness. An imperial WCIPA that packs enough bitterness. Fantastic. (Rating: 4.29)"
Affogato - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.49,"Whale hunting

Brewers Notes: Collaboration with J. Wakefield Brewing

We took our original J. Wakefield collaboration Affogato Imperial Stout and aged it in bourbon barrels for 6 months at our Hudson Road barrel house. Affogato Imperial Stout is inspired by a few of our brewers' favorite summertime pick-me-up (& cool-me-down) Barrington's affogato.

Barrel Aged Affogato Imperial Stout is decadent, rich and full. Brewed with a blend of Barrington & Mostra beans, Affogato leads with aromas of vanilla, toasted marshmallows and subtle notes of bourbon. Barrel Aged Affogato has a full, satisfying body and an indulgent palate of vanilla cream, hot cocoa, rich brownie batter, with complimentary doses of smooth coffee and bourbon.

MALT: American 2-Row Barley, Crystal 120, Flaked Oats, Black Malt, Chocolate Malt, Munich Malt, White Wheat Malt, Brown Sugar, Dark Candied Syrup, Lactose
HOPS, ETC: Columbus, Barrington and Mostra Coffees, Madagascar Vanilla Beans

On tap at Trillium Canton, 5oz snifter , black motor oil , thin dark brown big bubbled layer quickly settles to a ring

Aroma is cocoa, brown sugar, bourbon, and yes brownie batter

Taste is bourbon, cocoa, brownies, coffee

Fizzy mouthfeel , rich, decadent , 13.8% abv, this is a sipper

Good beer"
Susan,4.39,"On tap at Sabatinis in Exeter pa early this evening.

Hazy amber body with a small white head that still manages to leave dripping rings of lacing. Aroma is faintly hoppy and fruity. However, on tasting, an initial burst of fruity hops and some sweetness. This moves on to a bitter warming hoppiness in the finish.

Excellent couple of pints at the end of a long day."
Susan,4.2,"Excellent beer. Easy drinking, and very reasonable alcohol 6.2. just right for a Thursday night!"
Susan,4.44,"Pours a lovely hazy gold, with a decent sized head. The aroma is restrained and is more malty than hoppy. However the flavor is all about citrus and stone fruit with a pleasant bitterness that lasts a long time. Medium body."
Susan,4.02,Draught. Bitter and black pepper. Meh.
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,4.75,"By far one of the greatest stouts
That I’ve ever had aside from the dragons milk bourbon stout
With this beer in hand the taste is amazing
Chocolate with a slight hints of dark fruits maybe prunes couldn’t really pin point the flavoring with a strong aroma of a coffee after taste!!! This beer pairs very well with chicken mole enchiladas great combination!
You can easily find this beer at a grocery outlet! Overall it’s a great beer
Well done Alesmith company!"
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,4.9,"# 135, yum yum!"
"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",4.43,"Poured a beautiful black out of the can with a nice tan half-finger of head. Though next to no head retention, the tan floating ring that remains provides a beautiful contrast to the dark beer. Medium+ body, again a little sticky and syrupy. Definitely smells like a milk stout with some very muted vanilla notes. Palate follows with a balanced approach to the chocolate and vanilla. Some muted baking spices and coffee as well balance this out. Getting some lingering peanut/peanut butter on a long drawn out finish.

Really enjoying this one. Would love to reevaluate when fresh to see how the coffee plays to the flavor profile.

Overall, 4.5. Beautifully made!"
"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",4.75,"So smooth. You taste everything, the chocolate, coffee, vanilla and malts."
"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",4.5,"From a 16oz can dated Autumn 2023 into a tulip.

Pours a thick opaque black with about two fingers of brown head. Really good retention and decent lacing.

Crack of the can gives some coffee and bitter dark chocolate. Warming adds in some sweet milk chocolate and vanilla.

Taste follow...coffee, milk chocolate, vanilla, dark chocolate. Really well balanced and distinct.

Smooth, silky, full-bodied mouthfeel. Low carbonation. Mild, bittersweet aftertaste.

Nailed it. Probably enjoyed Moment of Clarity a bit more, but I'd never turn my nose up at this."
"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",4.38,"Canned Autumn 2023

Here we have yet another BA top 250 beer that I was able to pick up on my latest run to Tree House. This one eluded me for quite some time and I’m happy I was finally able to grab a 4 pack. It’s a fairly straightforward Milk Stout with basic adjuncts but Tree House tends to excel at that. Let’s dive right in

Pours completely pitch black with 2 fingers of frothy dark tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

There’s a delicate balance in the nose here that is just wonderful. I’m picking up on aromas of medium roast coffee, sweet vanilla, black cherry, cocoa powder, raisin, brown sugar, dark bread, and a touch of leather

While not quite as masterfully balanced in taste, this is still damn good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, light roast coffee, brown sugar, caramel, raisin, vanilla creme, dark bread, and light toffee. The swallow brings notes of black cherry, milk chocolate, medium roast coffee, vanilla creme, brown sugar, raisin, burnt caramel, and dark bread

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a silky beer. Finishes a tad sticky but it doesn’t hurt the drinkability

This one is just so damn good. Easy drinking and even though the adjuncts are present they aren’t aggressive"
"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",4.19,"Pours a deep dark brown color with a finger of tan head. The nose has notes of milk chocolate syrup and the chocolate notes carry over in the flavor.

This is a fine effort, but compared to other TH milk stouts in the same abv range, it is incredibly average."

Look- dark with tan head

Smell - Sweet milk chocolate and vanilla

Taste - Dark, roasty, and malty with a slightly burnt coffee finish. Not nearly as sweet as it smells, in a good way.
coffee finish

Feel - Not thick, not thin, creamy mouthfeel

Overall - Quite enjoyable. Expected it to be much sweeter like most treehouse milk stouts but this one was not overly sweet and very drinkable"
La Fosse,4.47,"Appearance - The beer was orange-yellow appearance with visible combination and a fluffy head.

Smell - A lot of peach came through in the nose. It was definitely tart.


Taste - The profile had a lot of ripe tart peach. It was not over tart and had a nice level of funk. It worked well together. It was pleasantly Earthy and even had a little spice.

Mouthfeel - The profile coated the tongue nicely, even with a higher level of carbonation.

Overall - This beer was superb."

Sublime nose and flavors, with apricot as the base note."
La Fosse,4.45,"Purchased a bottle of this beer at the brewery in March.

Poured into a tulip glass. Hazy yellow color with brief effervescent white head with little lacing. Smell and taste of ripe, tart fruit. Apricot and peaches. Tart but a mellow smooth flavor. Nice full feel. Wonderfully refreshing. Excellent wild ale."
La Fosse,4.49,"Taking inspiration from famous Brussel's apricot sour ale, Side Project is brewing more like pros when brewing and aging their own unique spin on the fruited gueuze style.

La Fosse brings a golden tinge to an otherwise bubbly champagne pour. But the beer strikes the nose with force as the overwhelming sour scent tightens the jaws and wets the whistle with fruit, funk and fauna. A scantly sweet introduction is of light wafer, sourdough and a brief hint of taffy.

But anything seeming sweet is short and succinct on the middle palate. The session quickly favors the stone fruit with a light orange, mango and peach character. Shying away from fruit rollup, the beer quickly trends vinous and winey with sharp chardonnay, bubbly dryness and a piquant spice. Its bracing acidity washes any thirst from the palate as the late taste brings an earthen tone of balsa, burlap and extended wood-age white wine.

Light, crisp and highly refreshing, the ale is a cleaner taste compared to more Brussels brewed versions, but this brighter, cleaner and fruitier version is just as good."
La Fosse,4.5,"Finally made it for a visit to Side Project and they happened to have bottles of this for on-site so got one and no regearts! Sour but not too sour and just fully of ripe, juicy apricot flavor; glad I got it!"
La Fosse,4.51,"Drank as part of a beer tasting with Ron. Not sure about the price. Cool bottle, neat cap. Consumed on 04/07/23, review from notes.

A&S: The beer's appearance is bright orange at first and moves to a muddy orange as the remaining beer and sediment are poured in. The head is fizzy and big, there is some lacing. The aroma is powerful! Chalky yeast, tart peaches, and apricots.

T&M: The taste is acidic, fruity, tart, and lemony. Very clean. Cereal finish. Tartness is cleared out when the sediment is poured in and the funk comes through more than before. The high carbonation is champagne-like at first, then comes in a little more creamy later on.

Overall: It is one of the better beers I have ever had. Perfect for a warm summer day."
Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,4.46,"On tap at Sabatinis in Exeter pa earlier this evening.

Hazy dull orange body, strong white head, rings of lacing. Magnificent aroma of mixed non citrus fruit which carries over into the taste. Abv well hidden, juicy, fruity, quite smooth. Finish is a lasting dance between mild bitterness and fruit. Excellent beer, which at $10.95 a pint it should be."
Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,4.5,"Pours a very hazy mango color with a creamy white head that provides a nice amount of lacing and maintains a ring around the body as you enjoy the beer. Beautiful hazy.

The nose is dank and citrusy, with tart tangerine, mango, and passion fruit notes, as well as a nice bit of apricot. Full on salivating at this point.

The taste is really led by a delightful interplay between the mango, apricot, and tart tangerine flavors equally delicious and accompanied by a bit of passion fruit. World class stuff here, IMHO.

The mouthfeel is medium and surprisingly lively for a hazy. Tree House rightfully gets loads of attention in the beer nerd world, but Trillium is every bit their equal, IMHO."
Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,4.7,I cannot add any more that others havent mentioned. The mouthfeel is just so smooth that I wish I had this locally. As good of a hazy as I have ever had. Worth it for the mouthfeel alone.
Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,4.5,"Picked up a four pack of cans at Curtis Liquors in Cohasset, MA for about twenty two dollars. My sixty third brew from these guys. Canned on date of 1/10/24. Excellent."
Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,4.49,"Draft at the brewery. Pours hazy gold/ orange with a 1"" head that disappears leaving nice lacing. Aroma: citrus and pineapple. Taste: pineapple and citrus, then malt with a bitter finish. A great NEIPA."
Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,4.28,"2024 Revisit: Can poured into a Mountain Rambler Brewery pint glass

A: Pours hazy golden amber with a frothy off white head that settles to a light layer and laces nicely.

S: Ripe tropical and stone fruit, a little melon, bright juicy citrus, green resinous grassy notes, a little pine, a touch of spice, faint earthy herbal notes, biscuity malt, and caramel honey sweetness.

T: Plenty of ripe tropical and stone fruit, pineapple, passion fruit, peach, apricot, mango, cantaloupe, and a hint of guava, juicy citrus, tangerine, lemon, and grapefruit, a little pine, resinous green grassy notes, a touch of spice, a little earthy slightly herbal undertone, biscuity malt, and caramel sweetness.

M: A touch on the fuller side of medium body, slightly prickly moderate carbonation, yet creamy smooth.

O: I had this one for the first time last year and was so utterly underwhelmed that I figured it was an off batch or something must have happened to it in transit. No way could my experience be so far off from such a normally highly regarded beer, so I vowed to give it a second chance as soon as I saw it again.
Really glad I decided to give it another chance, this can is completely different experience and much more along the lines of what everyone else has said about it. There's still a bit of a herbal earthy tone that I'm not in love with that is holding me back from scoring it higher, but it is significantly less pronounced than it was in my previous can.
My overall impression: They pulled just about everything there is to pull from Mosaic hops and paired it with a ridiculously smooth malt base. I wouldn't mind the earthy herbal side being minimized a bit more, but I'd happily buy this one again."
Truth - Vanilla Bean,4.53,"Received this amazing beer from Der WunderLlama in NBW BIF 18.
Poured like liquid black, with viscosity and heft. The brown bubbles that formed at the edges did manage to cover the surface for a moment or two. Then they just went away, leaving nothing but blackness in the glass.
The taste, just wow. I had a flash of the bourbon in the first sip or two but after that it retreated to the shadows. Coffee is present, but the star of this is the chocolate. Amped up by the vanilla, the chocolate manages to give the impression of chocolate lava cake, or at least the lava part. Yet somehow it isn’t very sweet. How that is possible is beyond me.
The feel is darned near chewy - it has HEFT. It seems to need all that body to carry all those flavors.
Exceptional beer."
Truth - Vanilla Bean,4.51,"Winter 2023 vintage

This is the last new beer from my recent trip up to Tree House. I was very excited to see this on the menu when I went, as it’s one of the last remaining Tree House beers in the BA top 250 that I haven’t tried yet. That being said, I’m not the biggest fan of just vanilla in a Stout, but I trust that they’ve got it figured out. Let’s dive right in

Pours completely pitch black with a slow forming dark tan head that fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing

The nose is damn nice here, the vanilla contributes a lot of different notes but it's still a bit subdued. I'm picking up on aromas of vanilla bean, jammy blackberry, molasses, milk chocolate, sweet bourbon, toasted oak, red grape, burnt sugar, and light caramel

Oh yeah, it opens up much more in taste, very complex but so easy to enjoy. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting chocolate fudge, vanilla bean, molasses, toasted oak, brown sugar, red grape, caramel candy, sweet bourbon, jammy blueberry, and light honey. The swallow brings notes of vanilla bean, earthy bourbon, milk chocolate, jammy blueberry, burnt sugar, red grape, caramel, charred oak, and spent coffee beans

A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a rich beer. Finishes a tad sticky but dries out over time

This one took me by surprise. Of all the big Stouts I've had from Tree House, this one isn't as sweet as the others tend to be. It's got a great evolution to it unlike similar beers"
Truth - Vanilla Bean,4.57,"This one is very similar to regular Truth -- a thick, sweet, fudgy stout with a just enough bourbon barrel character to cut through the immensity of the base beer -- but with the added benefit of copious vanilla character that adds even more dessert-like complexity into the mix. It's sort of a mashup between vanilla cake and super dense dark chocolate brownies. The balance of intense velevety viscocity while not being cloyingly sweet is really what makes this (and the other Truth variants) shine."
Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,4.39,"Liked this a bit more than the galaxy version - both pale in comparison to the DDH version, but this was really solid. A little more dank than the other two versions, but that's A-OK with me. Medium body, a little heavier than what I'd classify as an ""easy drinker,"" however these are perfect for a day at the pool, or cracking on a hot muggy day. Good to great beer - you won't be disappointed in this one."
Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,4.75,Canned 11/03/2020. Enjoyed on 11/27/2020.
Heavy Mettle,4.05,"Can from tfontana, thanks for the opportunity!
Hazy murky lemon orange color with a frothy white head that dissipates. Lemony grapefruity citrus with hints of mango and pineapple with a hint of pine and resin. Sweet bready malt underneath and a hint of warming alcohol. Far out and solid!"
Oude Geuze Golden Blend,4.51,"Pours a slightly hazy, golden honey color; fairly dense, slow-rising carbonation; thick, white head, dense and billowy. Incredible nose of mild green apple and dry Riesling wine; ripe pear; foeder wood; barest hint of barnyard funk. Sweet apple cider and white wine taste; pear and a nebulous sense of citrus like lemon and tangerine; mild to moderately acidic taste; little (if any) bitterness; faint hint of wooden barrel tones. Medium-heavy mouthfeel; moderately prickly on the palate; semi-juicy and acidic feel.

I was very pleased to find this beer locally and equally happy to drink it. The beer brings a nice, delicate overall flavor to the beer, is not overbearing with acidity or tartness, and goes down well on a mid-summer day.

Oude Geuze Golden Blend,4.46,"Peach color. Classic wild funk at the nose with a little mineral; taste very robust, citrus, maybe aged cheese, complexity beyond what I can describe. Very heavy carb. Aways a treat opening a lambic!"
Oude Geuze Golden Blend,4.63,"Bottle date 12/3/2014. Drank 12/25/2022.

Awesome."
Oude Geuze Golden Blend,4.57,"Pours a hazy golden, not in an IPA way, but a regular beer way. Frothy looking head. Fresh cut apples, some meyer Lemon on the nose. Sweet, champagne-like cider notes up front that is confronted by some sharp acidity. It is, overall, the right amount of acidity with the acidity presented in a very nice way. This is really nice, as advertised."
Oude Geuze Golden Blend,4.25,"L -- Golden amber body with a slight haze and a half finger of sudsy white head produced with aerated pour. Some retention and minimal lacing. Looks less cider-like than a lot of lambic
S -- Green apple candy, barnyard funk, dried floral, hint of herbal hop. Just super rustic and lambic-y
T -- Has that rustic, barnyard, funk-forward lambic thing going on again, but with a nice dose of lemon candy and oak
O -- Essentially a more refined version of 3F's standard gueuze

85/100"
Oude Geuze Golden Blend,4.17,"Look – A light amber color, with a nice head.

Smell – A pleasant tart smell with barnyard funk, oak, hay, and a light hint of vinegar.

Taste – Has a nicely dry tart flavor, very similar to the smell. Pleasant, but seems somewhat plain.

Feel – Nice carbonation, with a bit of tartness.

Overall – A very nice gueuze. One of the best I've tried, though that may not be my style."
Hommage,4.29,"750 ml bottle poured into a red wine glass (not all at once!). 2018 vintage, best by 2038. I've had this bottle since 2020 and figured it would be better not to wait too long to drink, in case the fruit fades over the years. Pours a clear pink color (at least until reaching the plentiful sediment lower in the bottle) with a quickly fading head. Aroma and flavor feature bracing acidity, sharp oak tannins, leather funk, background malt, no hops to speak of, and a surprising amount of bright raspberry flavor. Very low carbonation, maybe 10-15% of most beers, giving it almost but not quite a flat mouthfeel. It took a few sips to get used to but didn't detract too much from the overall enjoyment. Overall it's not for the faint of heart, and for fans of the style, this is a stellar beer. Great stuff."
Hommage,4.52,"poured from a corked and caged 375mL bottle (19/20 season bottled on 01/07/20 [July 1, 2020 for us ‘mericans]) into SP LC stemmed glassware. pours a beautiful, cloudy ruby red with a thin off-white foam cap that fades into a thin collar around the rim of the glass. sweet raspberries on the nose and taste. some oak and funky lambic in there as well. fairly sour but so damn good. full mouthfeel. was so happy to find this one on the shelves. it did not disappoint!"
Hommage,4.27,"Bottled in 13/9/18. 375 ml. I was saving this for beer #2000. But I guess I missed that milestone.

Poured into my cascade 8 oz glass.

Body is a vibrant ruby red to dark pink color. Pours absolutely flat with no head.

Nose is of an authentic Belgian lambic. Cheesecloth, oak barrel,vinegar, and Belgian funk. There is a soft raspberry background. Overall the nose is soft vs pungent and I'm not getting any cherry.

With the initial flavor the sour aspects from the lambic hit hard. There is a lot of sour cherry there. There are vinegar overtones that accent the sour flavor. The sour raspberry comes through for the finish and the sour fades temporarily and fresh fruity and juicy raspberry comes through along with a woodieness from the barrel. Left to linger long is a little bit of everything I just described.

The feel is somewhat thin and vineagary. The carbonation is present but very soft which is welcoming considering the consistency of the liquid and the sour punch the flavor packs.

Overall this is a fantastic classic Belgian lambic made like only the best Belgian breweries can make. I've been looking forward to this one for awhile and I am very happy I got to try it. Very classy. My only slight gripe is in the consistency of the mouthfeel- otherwise this is one of my favorite fruit lambics."
Hommage,4.49,"look - hazy fairly thick reddish brownish color with fantastic rimming and lacing
Smell - raspberry cherry woody funky...
Taste - all the same as the smell, slight acidic tartness
Feel - medium body with a slight dryness and a light carb
Overall - fantastic"
Hommage,4.47,"375ml green bottle. Corked and caged. Label has the bottling date as '07/01/2020' and good until '10/26/2040'.
Final dregs clouded up the dark cherry red body. Brief fizzy head but rising bubbles keep trying to form a ring. No lacing.
Aroma of raspberry, cherry, oak funk, and a little barley and wheat grain.
Taste is tart with raspberry, cherry, and oak funk. Some level of sweetness too. Underlay of barley and wheat malt. Quick exit in the aftertaste.
Medium mouth feel, with a bit of nectar. Drying finish, and some tooth scraping (acidic). Supportive carbonation.
The oak aging has resulted in an excellent blend of raspberry and cherry, along with the fermented malts. All exist on a naturally higher plane."
Hommage,4.25,"Bottle share at Temperance street with a bottle that wasn’t poured by myself
Pours a rose reddish body
Aroma is full Turkish Delight
Flavour is dry dry dryness"
Hommage,4.74,"Blend 75. Season 17/18. Tart, moderately acidic. Big raspberry flavor on top of that classic lambic funk. Delicious."
Hommage,3.7,"A: Pours purple/blood red color. A small pink/white head forms initially. Though that recedes quickly with little lace. That color is really stunning though.
S: Aromatic and tart berries and cherries up front and center. With an unmistakable earthy funk. There is a bit of oak and vanilla here as well. A really pungent and sharp aroma that I enjoy.
T: Oh boy, that sweet tart berry/cherry mix is there. Which becomes super acidic and sour. That funk, light oak and vanilla is there as well. Which tries to help balance. Though that acidic sourness becomes a little to much and makes this unbalanced for me.
M/O: A medium body that has a nice crisp bite. Really well carbonated. Definitely some sweetness as would be expected, but finishes with a dry bite as well. Pretty classic for the style, but still its slow going. That acidity takes over to much.

I love 3 Fonteinen, and this is a good example of the style for sure. Though it is unbalanced for me. There are other Fruit Lambic's that I prefer over this, but still you have to acknowledge that this is exactly what they wanted to make, and I do enjoy it. Just not love it as much as others in the style, or even others from this same brewery. I would recommend this, if you enjoy intense flavors, especially sour acidic cherries."
Smooth,2.79,B1. Almost definitely past prime. Very tart and acetic and not much nectarine character left
Smooth,4.3,"Yellow gold in color with a murky complexion. The aroma is of fresh nectarines and lactobacillius. I'm tasting fresh nectarine juice and lactobacillius, which on a day with a 100+ heat index is very refreshing. The mouth is crisp and moderately carbonated."
Smooth,4.5,Finally got to visit Side Project and this bad boy happened to be on and did not disappoint. Great acid level that was not overpowering and was just dripping with ripe nectarine flavour; phenomonal beer!
Smooth,4.24,Burnt orange with white head that quickly disappears. Tart nectarine and barnyard funk. Crisp and dry. Overall quite nice.
Smooth,4.42,Pours an amber orange with white head. Aroma of oranges and grapes. Hits you with a sour pucker that fades. Lots of orange nectarine with vinous notes. Very well done.
Smooth,4.19,"Look - clear golden with great rimming
Smell - tart yeasty grain
Taste - fantastic nectarine tartness
Feel - light and crisp slight syrup
Overall - really nice beer"
Saison Bernice,4.03,"750ml capped bottle into a Side Project snifter.

Pours a bright sunrise. Foamy 2 finger white head. Sparse lace, thin, slick legs. Nose is acidic stone fruit. Light vinegar, dried prunes, apricot pit. Beer opens white vinegar, old stone fruit pit, and dried plum. Foam, wet wood, and apricot pit towards the end. Cobwebs, hay, and a tart funk at the finish. Body is light with ample carbonation. Prickly on the palate and goes down lively with a long aftertaste."
Saison Bernice,4.79,"Appearance - The beer was an orange, yellow color with visible carbonation and a half inch of head.

Smell - the nose was citrusy, but you can still detect farmhouse funk. It tickled the nose nicely.

Taste - At the front, I detected lemon, and other citrus fruits. Notes of grass and green apples were also present. The funk balanced the fruit flavors, making for a well-balanced version of the style.

Mouthfeel - The viscosity allowed the profile to stick to the tongue and roof of the mouth, even with high carbonation.

Overall - I may have a new favorite saison."
Saison Bernice,4.54,"Somehow eluding me for over a decade, despite several trades with SARA locals, my first draft pour at Good Vibes 2023 appears lightly hazy maize yellow-orange with a dense khaki foam blanket that retains well.

This exhibits a surprisingly solid funk that's as if oaked, as well as some aged cheese that's cut by an apricot-lemon tartness accented by a refreshing hint of lime.

The fairly crisp body finishes just dry in the swallow.

I can see why this is so well-regarded."
Saison Bernice,4.52,"Superb appearance in the glass…bright golden yellow color with extremely fine, delicate white head. Aromas of Brett, lemon and grassy hay. Taste is a burst of lemony tartness and funk. A very light, delicate mouthfeel with spritzy carbonation. Just about a perfect saison in my book."
Saison Bernice,4.21,"Poured from a capped 750mL bottle into my Troubadour tulip.

Nearly clear Arylide yellow body with a steady stream of micro-bubbles. Off white cap disappears rapidly. Almost no lacing, nor legs.

Subtle complex yeast-driven aromatics suffused with poolish, fresh cut hay, and stone fruit. Floral, with a whisper of white wine/champagne.

Bright with a balance of light grain/malt, tart meyer lemon/unripe pear, and a faint peppery/barnyard edge from the Brett. Light clean bitterness with a touch of alfalfa and clover. Long, medium-dry finish reveals full maturation and synergy of ingredients.

A bit thin and fizzy with lingering acidity. What meager roundness is present seems almost (but not quite) chalky.

Excellent aroma and flavor, a core expression from the brewery, but the body is more like a lambic than a saison - perhaps this was not a great bottle/batch, but at the price point I'm not eager to roll the dice again right away."
Upper Case,4.29,"Dense orange colour.

Smell is citrus, malt maybe some piney resin. Somewhat generic smell.

Taste is the same.

Feel is dense, not much bitterness.

Good, but not outstanding, ddh fort pint was certainly better."
Upper Case,4.0,Poured from a 16 0z can with a birff date of 07/10/24. Pours opaque orange-yellow with one finger head that rapidly recedes. Smells of an orangecicle; tastes of sweet citrus with light pleasant hops as an accompany. Good!
Upper Case,4.23,"The pour that emptied a pint can's contents into a clear glass liter mug produced that nearly stark white foam that bears witness to a wheat inclusion. The foam recedes unevenly, unattractively and in this case, slowly. The body is dull apricot-amber, approaching murky. In short, it looks like the typical modern American IPA. Thankfully, it smells much better than it looks. There's at least a sharp citrus/pine noting to the hops. A malty counterbalance, not so much. The description of the taste is basically a repeat of the words used for the smell. The 9% ABV is noticed, as it adds to the hop bite, but not as a detriment. Also, there's a little more starchy sweetness than predicted by the nose, but it's shallow. Taste references would be pineapple and lemon, backed by a good earthy hop bite. The mouthfeel is average for the style, maybe just a little better for something that carries this much alcohol. There's some stratified glass lacing that enhances its looks. Overall, for something that obviously has wheat in its wort, this isn't bad, especially for one that hits with such potency."
Upper Case,4.9,"#176, yummy!"
Coconut B-Bomb,4.34,"2017 vintage

I know this one is a bit old, and I was honestly surprised to see this older vintage on Tavour, but given how highly regarded this one is I just couldn’t pass it up. I’m sure the coconut is past its prime but it’ll probably still be good. Let’s dig in

Pours a very dark brown with a finger of light tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

The nose is quite sweet, but there’s a surprising amount of coconut left and still rather balanced. I’m picking up on aromas of sweet bourbon, molasses, brown sugar, raisin, raw coconut, chocolate fudge, vanilla bean, burnt caramel, and light tobacco

It doesn’t hold up quite as well in taste, but I can’t really say I have any complaints. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting chocolate fudge, sweet bourbon, toasted oak, molasses, vanilla, burnt caramel, brown sugar, black cherry, and light coconut. The swallow brings notes of cocoa powder, vanilla bean, toasted coconut, molasses, brown sugar, raisin, burnt caramel, and earthy bourbon

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes mostly dry with a very slight boozy heat

This held up better than I expected actually. Not that I’ve ever had a fresh one but still"
Coconut B-Bomb,4.6,"2017 vintage. Still plenty of coconut flavor. Pours with a brown head and mild lacing. Scents of bourbon, coconut, cocoa, and caramel, all of which carry over to the taste. Hints of dark fruit on the under current. Medium bodied, easy sipper, subtle booze presence. Quite enjoyable."
Coconut B-Bomb,4.09,"This is for the 2019 release; sent to me by @colts9016 as part of NBW BIF #15
Poured nearly black, which for a winter ale was a bit surprising. Still, capped with the brown head it looked quite enticing.
The aroma was bourbon, and that’s about it.
The taste followed- there was some roasted malts that came through but I couldn’t find any coconut in the mix. Not sure if if it “aged out” or something, but I never found it.
The feel was excellent for the flavors, bourbon is a sipping drink you know.
I am glad to have tried this, but would like to revisit a fresher version if possible."
Coconut B-Bomb,4.35,Bottle: Poured a deep brown color ale with a large brown foamy head. Aroma of strong coconut notes with some sweet caramelized malt and chocolate notes is quite enticing. Taste is a mix of strong coconut notes with sweet caramelized malt notes and some chocolate notes. Body is full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol notes. Very enjoyable if you like coconut.
Coconut B-Bomb,4.34,"Look - black thick w tan head and reading rimming and lacing
Smell - coconut chocolate a ton of barrel
Taste - toasted coconut with a ton of barrel along with chocolate and vanilla
Feel - medium full body with a light carb and creamy
Overall - really tasty warmer"
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,4.78,"Picked up this special 37,5cl bottle at the brewery/tasting room in Beersel/Lot. No. 5 blend, 22|23 season, bottled 11/08/2022, best before 10/26/2042. While buying I was told that this is one of their blends that is from lambic brewed fully in-house, as opposed to some of their ""less special"" blends including some lambic from other breweries nearby. This specific blend has up to four-year old lambic at the time of bottling and the final blend comes from four different barrels and six different beers. As expected, this is difficult to describe. So complex. So much going on. Also quite strong. The yeast, the funk, the acidity, the near fruit-like qualities. This is lambic taken to another level. Obviously a world-class blend."
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,4.38,"(12.7 oz bottle, 6.9% abv, bottling date 26 JUN 18; purchased single off shelf at Benash today... poured into a Sapwood-branded wine glass almost identical to the stemmed vessels shown on 3Fonts website)

L: cloudy, amber liquid; persistent razor collar, but little foam upon pour.. looks like puddle piddle

S: classic, wet, glassy-grassy aromas... damp earth, spidery spice (must and mist)... just textbook, but missing some chlorophyllic zip

T: leathery-malty, funk-drenched, pizza-crusty (herbal, baked, earthy)... musty lemon pants persists... too booming bold on all fronts... arresting mound muncher, wow!... hints of sherry in the aftertaste; building, mounting... faint acv dank, but not zippy acidic

F: sloppy smooth, slightly sizzly... thick slide with some sultry heat... not the levity I crave with a gueuze, but it'd fit nicely with light, greasy meats or seafoods

O: a lot of dirty, brash, antique slosh... it holds up too well after 5 years here, but it shows subtle signs of becoming a relic raunch... I'd get bottles of this now at this age and price --- DO IT!!! (2238)"
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,4.59,"The beer pours a very bubbly white head that dissipates very quickly. The beer itself is a clear brownish orange color that looks nice.

The smell is very good. It has an orange note upfront with a bit of funk and oak underneath it.

The taste is delicious. It has a strong orange note with a light funk and light toffee finish. There is a light oak note to it.

The feel is very good. The beer has a light body to it but a good texture so that it doesn't feel thin. It has a tingling
sensation. The acidity is really nice. It's very similar to that of orange juice; not taxing for the average person.

Overall, a fantastic gueuze that's perfect for the hot weather to drink or to have something during the day. It isn't overly taxing on the palate."
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,4.39,"Blend no. 77, season 17|18, bottled 21 sep 18 (based on the ""best before"" date, this is 2018-09-21), corked and caged 750ml bottle.

Clear golden orange, fizzy low head. Smells funky and bright, dirt floor plus flower. Tastes, wow, so much going on. Crisp acidity plus funk, some overripe fruit flavors, coming in waves. Feel is outstanding - light and tingly but lasting on the tongue. Really good stuff."
Foggier Window,4.19,"Picked this up when I was out in Torrance last summer, as I had the rest on the way home and put this last can in the basement. Had a few of their collaborations with Other Half over the years and yes, this was just as good as what I expected from them!

Juicy and hazy in appearance, this had all the characteristics of a typical New England IPA. A nice head topped this off as it was full, settled evenly, and took quite a while to dissipate. One thick ring of lacing remained near the top of my pint glass a there were enough scattered suds the rest of the way down. Lots of tangy citrus, white grape, and dank hops in the nose as the taste was just as smooth as the mellow aroma was inviting. Some fruit cocktail and heavy stone fruit emerged near the back as this was plenty strong and not carbonated all that much.

Thankfully, the body was spot-on as indeed, this reminded me of more familiar brews from these parts. Canned on what looked to be 7/25 of last year, that had ""FOG ADVISORY"" written below it as indeed, this was a bit foggy in nature. Glad to have visited this brewery and to get one of their better offerings there, as I hope to make my way back to Torrance again later this year!"
Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,4.25,"Can poured into a Mountain Rambler Brewery pint glass

A: Pours hazy golden amber with a frothy cream white head that settles to a firm layer and laces nicely.

S: Juicy tropical and stone fruit, ripe citrus, floral notes, a touch grassy and earthy, biscuity malt, and caramel honey sweetness.

T: Ripe tropical and stone fruit, peach, apricot, guava, mango, passion fruit, and hints of white grape, juicy citrus, orange and a touch of lime, underlying grassy earthy notes, a bit floral, biscuity malt, and caramel honey sweetness.

M: A little on the fuller side of medium body, moderate carbonation, soft on the palate.

O: This can managed to hide in my fridge for a few weeks but I'd say it's held up just fine. Gives the full Galaxy experience with a fun twist of wildflower honey. If I ever see this one again I'll have to snap it up and see how much better it is super fresh."
Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,3.76,Maybe a bad batch but the flavors were super muted and didn't pop like a normal trill beer.
BDCS,4.41,"2024-07-06
12oz can served in a slightly tulipy stemmed glass. 2023 vintage, no other date that I see. Got it from @russpowell in NBS BIF #18.

Pours black, opaque, small brown ring of head, slow active carbonation visible around the edges. Smell is black licorice and black coffee, molasses and oaky booze, char and vanilla.

Taste is similar, but throw in a huge dose of caramel, toning down all the bitterness associated with char and coffee, brings about more of a chocolate malt flavor.

Mouthfeel is creamy, rich, smooth, but nowhere near heavy. Overall, this is an excellent beer."
BDCS,3.79,"Cola black with a thin mocha head that quickly settles into a crown. Dark malt, licorice and marshmallow in the nose. Similar taste with some slight nuttiness and leather behind. A hint cinnamon-like wood in there, too. Thin feel with tight, soft fizz. Quality brew, but not a wow beer. (2023 version.)"
BDCS,4.19,"Very good head production and decent retention, given the ABV and barrel treatment. After settling into the glass, it retains a lovely thin but noticeable dark brown ring of foam.

Nose prominently features bourbon and oak, but not at the expense of the rich, roasty malt base. Notes of chocolate, red grape, prune, vanilla, honeycomb, molasses, coffee, and a touch of anise.

Quite creamy on the palate, more than usual for a milk stout. The cream and vanilla notes blend harmoniously with the sweet bourbon profile, likely leading to that unusually strong character. Roastiness is present but not over the top. Impressively smooth, both in flavor and mouthfeel. Additional tasting notes of toast, light coffee, red grape, and semi-sweet chocolate.

Supremely smooth BBA imperial (milk) stout, but it reminds me quite a bit of Dragon's Milk (but smoother). The creaminess borders on cloying, if not quite reaching that point; the bourbon is fairly simple and straightforward; the malt base could use a bit more oomph.

Very tasty beer, but for one generally considered a bit of a legend, I'm a little let down."
BDCS,4.33,"Wow. This one is cleaner than using Niagara Falls as a bidet. I mean, it’s smoother than Alain Delon on Xanax. It sits there like a lake, any lake, your favorite lake, at 6 am before the frat boys tear it to shreds after countless Natty Lights."
BDCS,4.48,"Sampling a cellar temp 12 oz can poured into my snifter, vintage 2022 but no other date stamp on the label. Received in a trade courtesy of @russpowell. thank you!

the beer pours a rich dark coffee brown color and no light passes through my glass when I hold it to a light source.
A dense creamy head of 1 cm of tan foam rises up from the pour and quickly fades to a sturdy edge layer that sticks around throughout my sampling. There are also a few small islands spinning in the center of the glass. Also get some scattered lacing when I swirl the glass or take a sip.
Aroma is malt forward with milk chocolate, vanilla, brown sugar and a good whiff of bourbon note. No warm or fusol alcohol more of the sweet side of bourbon. Also no hop presence here at all on the nose.
First sip reveals a very smooth textured medium bodied beer with fine soft and gentle carbonation. The carb is very fine and gentle, which all makes for a velvety smooth physical experience.
Flavor is what the nose advertises, with sweet chocolate, brown sugar and some vanilla, all giving way to bourbon notes and a little warming on the swallow. Bourbon flavor lingers and also coats my lips. I do get a little bit of a coffee note in the back of each swallow too. Again, no hops to be found.
Quite a nice imperial milk stout, one that I would gladly drink again."
BDCS,4.36,"12oz can courtesy of Russpowell. 2022 vintage. 10.3% abv, 69 IBUs (whatever they mean, anymore) per UT.

Poured into a snifter, this was an inky black, with no interest in becoming any lighter even when held up to light. Modest, half inch of khaki-mocha colored head. Sparse, spotty lacing.

Bourbon up front in the nose, along with milk chocolate and coffee notes, pretty much in that order.

More complex in the taste than in the nose. Still bourbon-y up front, and with a milk chocolatey sweetness, but there's also a bit of tobacco and dark fruit to the flavor. It all melds together very, very well.

Body is a little bit lighter than I expected, but not to a deal-breaking extent. Mouth feel is fairly creamy.

This is a very nice BBA stout, one that hit the spot after dinner tonight. Earlier this week I found out for certain that my Mom does not have stomach cancer, as was feared for a time. I decided to drink this beer today to celebrate that fact, and I don't think I mis-chose at all. I would happily drink this beer again as a dessert or nightcap. Thanks, Russ!"
BDCS,4.49,"Opaque dark brown body; thick, creamy, light tan head. Milk chocolate and vanilla tones on the nose. Incredibly smooth and complex flavors; milk chocolate; very subtle sense of whiskey; vanilla; light cinnamon spiciness; light bitterness peeking below the overall sweetness. Heavy body; dense and silky on the palate; very muted boozy warmth.

This is just an awesome barrel aged imperial stout - a double cream stout per the notes. The base beer really shines while the barrel aging amplifies but doesn't overpower the beer. Depth and complexity are rife with this beer. Very, very tasty.

BDCS,4.21,"Label is marked 'BDCS 2022'.
Black colored body, with a very thin edge of mahogany colored edge.
Aroma of smooth blended aromas of roasted malts and chocolate malts.
Taste of sweet chocolate and stout malt.
Sweet nectar mouth feel. Quiet carbonation.
Rich in nose and flavors, try it if you can."
BDCS,4.84,"12oz can pours dark shiny black like used motor oil with a brief mocha colored head which leaves a ring of foam around the top of the glass.

Aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, cream, oak, vanilla, and bourbon.

Taste is very similar to the aroma with roasted malt, chocolate, cream, bourbon, dark roast coffee, vanilla, a hint of char, and the taste of dark fruits (cherry) mingling about. Is initially sweet but quickly replaced with the bourbon.

Mouthfeel is oily smooth with a little carbonation and boozy alcohol warmth.

Dangerously easy to drink for a 10.2% AVB BA Stout.

I’m fortunate to live close, so I’ll be stocking up for the long year in-between releases."
Impermanence,3.83,"Can shared by Paul thanks for the opportunity.
Inky black color with a small tan head that dissipates quickly. Sweet rich sticky roasty caramel chocolate and maple syrup off set with hints of alcohol and earthy hops. Its a sweet sipper for sure but quite tasty."
Impermanence,4.66,"From a can. Pours pitch black with a caramel head. The nose is very sweet and maple heavy, but a nice roasty coffee that follows. Taste follows suit with a fair amount of maple, but the balance is superb. A very sticky but not overly sweet beer. This is one of my favorite maple stouts from TH, behind only Moment of Clarity, but this is a solid support act."
Impermanence,5.0,"Impermanence has a deep, rich, and opaque black color. It has a creamy, dense, and long-lasting head of tan foam that leaves attractive lacing on the glass. Impermanence is rich and complex, with a strong presence of dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and a hint of dark fruit. The coffee notes are bold and robust, chocolate adds a smooth sweetness that balances out the bitterness from the roasted malts. The dark fruit notes are subtle, but add an extra layer of depth and complexity to the aroma. Overall, the aroma of the Impermanence Stout is truly captivating and leaves you eager to take a sip. On the palate, Impermanence has a rich, full-bodied flavor profile that is both complex and satisfying. The initial taste is a strong, bitter espresso-like flavor, which is quickly followed by notes of dark chocolate and roasted malt. This is balanced out by a hint of sweetness from the malt. Impermanence has a creamy and silky mouthfeel that makes it a pleasure to drink. The texture is thick and smooth, coating the palate. The body is medium to full, providing a substantial and satisfying experience with each sip. The carbonation is low, giving the stout a smooth and creamy finish without being too fizzy. Overall, the mouthfeel of this stout is well-balanced and luxurious. Overall, Tree House Brewing Impermanence is an outstanding stout! With its rich flavor, smooth finish, and attractive appearance, it is sure to be a hit with anyone who tries it."
Impermanence,4.9,"#143, great milk stout"
Impermanence,4.46,"Appearance: Pours near black with a two finger beige head; good retention and leggy with a showering of lace

Smell: Roasted malt, dark chocolate, caramel and coffee with maple syrup supporting

Taste: Roasted malt, dark chocolate and caramel forward with coffee, vanilla and maple syrup adding a variety of dimensions; finishes with lingering roast and maple syrup

Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation

Overall: A very nice milk stout that avoids the cloying sweetness that plagues many of the beers of this style; the way the roasted malt and coffee offsets the sweetness of the caramel and maple syrup is impressive

Thanks, devoured_by_vermin, for the opportunity"

Triple Citra Daydream,4.24,"Cloudy as expected with a white-hued, darker gold color. Smaller head that settles fairly quickly. Some random streaks and spots are left on the glass as the beer is consumed.

Fresh cut wet, green hop nose initially. Some dried apricot notes for the malt. Slightly sweet with a bit of weediness in the background.

Smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel. This is enhanced with a fine, small-bubbled carbonation. There's a moderate sweetness juiciness that culminates in the swallow. The lactose sugar is evident but subtle. I do not pick up on any of the oats, but I'm sure they contribute to the richness of the beer. This started with a strong bittering finish, but subsequent swallows offer a far more balanced offering. This beer becomes easier to drink with each passing sip, perhaps it's the 10.5% abv...."

Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.21,"2019 bottle, Drank 7/31/23

Pours dark black, zero carbonation. Strong pleasant aroma of chocolate and molasses. Taste is much of the same with an added hint of coffee and bourbon barrel. Feel is thin, and FLAT which really distracts from this being a top BA stout for me. Overall it’s ok taste wise, but maybe 4 years old was way to long to wait on this one"
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.4,"Lift Bridge Silhouette Barrel Aged Imperial Stout. 2014. Bottle Number 239. 750 ml. 1 Pint, 9.4 fluid ounces. Alc. 10% by Volume. Aged in bourbon barrels. Brewed and bottled by Lift Bridge Brewing Company in Stillwater, MN, USA. ""The Cold War is over. Serve at 55-60. Degrees. (I still don't know the key for that one.) I will skip the the gobbledygook until later.

(Note: this is one of those very rare occasions when I don't have a photo of the beer I consumed to go along with the notes. I plugged in the iPod touch that use to take them and found nothing. How is this possible? It's part of my regular routine, I never forget to take the pictures. Could I have accidentally deleted them somehow? That's even less likely. Perhaps I was just so excited to drink the beer that I forgot to take that essential early step in my ritual. So, once I realized there were no photos, I fished the empty bottle out of the recycling, and posed it next to the as yet un-washed glass I drank it from. That's not even the true beer in there, I followed Silhouette with another bottle.


I bought this two weeks ago at the brewery. Wish I had another to save and age and savor in the future, but this is the one, and I'm drinking it now. (I'd actually never even heard of this beer, must have been sleeping or something when it was released last year.)


Solid blackness in this one (the darkest beer I've had from this brewery), with a rich, roast tan head that starts big, slims down and stays awhile.

Aroma leaps out and spills the bourbon all over the place. Additional notes of charcoal, molasses, caramel, toffee, dark fruit, …vanilla. Always vanilla. And I like it.

Taste: Ah, mmm, and yeah, huh. Deepness and richness in abundance. This has got everything it needs and it lasts and lasts. Immensely indulgent. Chocolate and espresso and everything dark and deep and delicious. MMM, I'll say it again. And what else? Licorice. We call it anise sometimes. And all those other things.

It's a thing of hugeness and a richness and wonderfully rewarding to the drinker. this is all relative. I am loving this and this is not a chore at all, it is a delight. If you want to read about a chore, check my review of Stone's Crime and Punishment. Yikes, talk about trial and error!

Hey, let's read the gobbledygook. ""Silhouette is as deep and dark as the Northern woods. It's brewed in the style of an Imperial Stout. Aromas of coffee, chocolate, molasses and prune meld with a unique dark roasted character. . The beer is complex, rich and full bodied. It's wild spirit will warm the senses, illuminate the soul, and grow into a traditional favorite…no matter what season."""
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.45,"2020 bottling, 12 oz bottle.

I walked on by this beer many times in the store because I considered it to be overpriced (yeah, I know... it's a ""99 World-Class"" here, but we're suckers for a BA Imperial stout...).

Anyhow, in a weak moment, I did order one from my favorite curb-side pickup store a while back, and it sat in my 'fridge, and sat, until I finally moved it to the cellar to make room for other beers.

It's back in the refrigerator for Cellaruary.

So, today is the day. I won't be able to compare it to the beer fresh, though, since this is my first tasting of this beer.

Taken from a ~42° refrigerator and allowed to warm for 30 minutes or so unopened. Drinking started at mid-50°'s (a guess).

Opaque black topped by a ½ inch creamy-appearing dark tan head with short retention. Little visible carbonation and what lacing does appear with a tip of the glass quickly slides back down into the tan ring. The ring eventually disappears completely, leaving a still surface.

Very strong aroma. Bourbon first, then barrel. Molasses. Slight hint of vanilla.

Rich flavor, mirroring the aroma. Bourbon, oak, vanilla, sweet molasses. Adding to the party is roasted malts and dark fruits. Toward the finish and into the aftertaste, dark chocolate appears along with the alcohol, slightly warming my mouth in the after. The finish is sweet vanilla and dark chocolate.

The body is substantial, approaching viscous (but not quite getting there).

Overall, this BA stout is excellent, indeed. A rich aroma and flavor, a substantial body, lots of bourbon and barrel without overpowering the underlying Imperial stout flavors, a sweet, but controlled sweetness, finish. It's not a dessert beer, but an excellent evening sipping beer. If I'm feeling like splurging, I may actually buy it again!"
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.53,"REview#1600,This thing is all barrel, but that's not a bad thing in this case. If I had to say something bad about it I would say it is sorta harsh and abrasive at times, overpowering and (this sounds dumb) kinda too smooth at other times... unbeer-like if that makes sense, tastes like some sort of new better drink that supersedes beer into a more betterer territory"
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.35,"Pours black with leakage to mahogany brown on the edges and a tan head. The nose has oaky, boozy barrel notes, some dark chocolate, and stone fruit.

The barrel is forward on the taste, coasting into the dark chocolate and stone fruit notes, which works really well. The mouthfeel is full, but just the slightest bit watery. Overall, thought this is outstanding."
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.9,"#83, good stuff!"
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.52,"A slight fizz, but then no head. Nearly black, pours thick.
Smell is a sweet molasses and caramel.
Taste is smooth, balanced. Not as complex as some, but still extremely flavorful. Plum and molasses.
Feel is outstanding. Creamy and silky smooth.
An excellent beer!"
Bomb!,2.62,"Well, this must be an acquired taste. Very boozy."
Bomb!,4.46,"This is one dangerous beer. Little head, smell is sweet coffee like you wake up to in heaven. Unlike the big bad bourbons, the 13% is well hidden. Silky smooth feel. If this doesn't score in my top ten I'll be shocked."
Bomb!,2.68,"For me, one of the most objectional beers i've recently had....very dark, very boozy, some vanilla ands little heat to boot...just awful, this one found the drain quickly...sorry not a fan in the slightest."
Bomb!,4.38,"Pours jet black. Aroma is coffee, chocolate fudge, salted caramel, and some slight booze. There is a touch of earthiness from the peppers but it's subtle. Taste follows suit. Alcohol well hidden for the abv. Rich and delicious. This just doesn't look great in a glass and the touch of booze on the aroma is knocking this down a bit."
Bomb!,4.64,"L - - deep brown, nearly pitch black with mahogany highlights and a tan head that dissipates quickly, leaving behind no real lacing to speak of
S - smoky chilis and roasted, bitter coffee, with rich dark chocolate, with roasted coffee notes
T - everything is intermixed well - rich roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and smoky ancho chilis along with vanilla and caramel
F - full bodied with light carbonation
O - a pretty fantastic stout that's probably overshadowed by abraxas and BA abraxas"
Bomb!,4.46,"L: Pours a dark hickory, forms no head and a very thin espresso ring around the edge of the snifter. No noticeable lacing or retention, with a distinctive oily character. Has a crunchy, dark chocolate hue when held to the light.

S: Cacao nibs, bourbon barrel, oak, vanilla, and coffee. Hints of chili heat.

T: Strong coffee roast, cacao nibs, vanilla, and roasted malts. Slightly astringent. Faint chili burn in finish.

F: Medium- to full-bodied. Thick, creamy mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation.

O: The sun rises in the east, Prairie delivers another outstanding stout."
Bomb!,4.47,"Got a bottle of this from Charleston Beer Exchange years ago. Finally getting a chance to try it and I am stocked. I have had this fresh on draft but that was probably 6 years ago and I was unable to get a review done.

Pours pitch black with a small, wispy toffee colored head. Sporadic lacing. Aroma is coffee and chocolate and figs and alcohol. Mouthfeel is a little thin for my liking. Slightly watered down but wonderful flavor overall. I enjoyed the draft version more and this bottle was a bit of a letdown. Solid beer but plenty better."
Bomb!,4.75,"Look: exceptionally dark brown, almost black. Very thin mocha colored head, minor lacing.

Smell: very well-mixed chocolate and vanilla fight for dominance. Moderately strong coffee and malt.

Taste: follows the nose. The chocolate, vanilla, coffee, and malt sweetness are all present. Nothing is overpowering. No real taste of chile peppers until the back end (see feel).

Feel: rich, silky, velvety, and smooth. Low carbonation as expected given the style and the 13% abv. Warmth from the alcohol during and after swallow. Tingling spice on the tongue (from the chile peppers) long after the swallow.

Overall: one of the best - and possibly THE best - adjunct imperial stout I have ever had the fortune of trying. Exquisitely well-balanced flavors."
Bomb!,4.54,"This one is rich, dark and creamy. I taste all the flavors except the heat from the chiles. Maybe since it's a year old the chiles have subsided. Still a fantastic brew."
Consecration,4.8,"Look: Pours a crystal clear ruby-red to amber and the short-lived head quickly fizzles out, leaving no lacing behind

Aroma: Whoa baby. Oak, black currants, hints of dark cherry, wood tannins, leather, faint wafts of chocolate, a berry-led fruity blend, subtle acidity, Cabernet wine, and fine tobacco

Taste: Wow, the taste just doubles down on the nose. Starts off with a slowly building black currant note that is joined by a range of berry-led fruit, Cabernet, and dark cherry and peaks as layers of Brett yeast come to the forefront. Tobacco, leather, oak, and wood tannings take over and the fruity and earthy interplay is extremely dialed in with both components, complimenting rather than combatting each other. The light chocolate and tobacco hold through and lay the groundwork for what is a sour and spritzy finish, while still continuing to be smooth. No ethanol is detectable

Mouthfeel: Full, clean, medium to medium-low carbonation, and tart and smooth on the finish

Overall: This is one exquisite beer. This is my first ever Russian River Wild Ale and one I’ve been wanting to try for over 15 years so finally ponied up for it and damn, it blew my hyped expectations out of the water. A delicious concoction that really sets the bar high for Wild Ales as it incorporates so much depth and subtly into each sip and comes together effortlessly. My big-time praise to RR for this gem and glad I finally experienced this legend-of-a-beer"
Consecration,4.13,"12.7oz corked and caged bottled 1/30/23 and opened 10/17/23.
Small pop upon opening, thin off white head with short retention. Deep copper/amber color…glowing with limited clarity.
Initial aroma is sour fruit and mild barrel - overall very vinous nose. Sour cherry, oak,
Bright entry, high acid and a palate cleansing mouthfeel. Slight zing and tannin along with fine carbonation that scrubs the palate with each sip."
Consecration,4.41,An extremely complex beer. Had the pleasure of drinking this at Iron Abby in Horsham PA. A fruity plum on the nose. I can taster the plum as well as some notes you will find in a Cabernet such as tobacco with a sour and dry finish.
Consecration,4.2,"Served from a tap in a clear pint glass, it's modest biege head didn't last long. The brew is a deep brown-amber, almost mahogany, bright and surprisingly clear for all the color. The only aroma is that almost woody sourness common to good barrel aged ales. The barrel tannins dominate even the Brettanomyces and currants to taste. no minor feat. Yet, the taste is complex enough that they can be specifically detected. There are too many sours that are really some degree of tart. This is also a little tart, but it's unmistakably sour. The woody tannins linger a little too long in the aftertaste. Other than that, there's no complaint here. The high ABV isn't noticed, the taste is full and complex, delivered within a body that's rich for the style."
Consecration,4.0,Good sour and barrel flavors.
DFPF,4.23,"Drank from a 1 pint, 9.4 fl oz (750 ml) bottle purchased at Gordon’s Fine Wines & Liquors, Watertown, MA
Served in a tulip

The beer was an absolutely gorgeous, crystal clear ruby color in the bottle and appeared the same way in the glass. A short-lived, bubbly, light pink cap of froth topped the liquid, but it quickly dissolved. Spotty lacing trickled down the glass after the first few sips.

The aroma was impressive and very tropical fruit forward. Dank, musty guava notes came through strongest. Lots of overripe mango as well. Touch of passionfruit. The tropical fruit qualities were very reminiscent of those one might find in an IPA. Slightly wheaty. Some tart lime was also detectable.

The flavor profile was solid but more sour and acidic than I anticipated. Bit of dry, crackery malts and tartness up front before the fruitiness kicked in. Lemon notes came through strongest and were well matched by a lush, berry-like quality. Slightly wheaty. Touch of passionfruit. I definitely would not pick out the dragon fruit, though I am not very familiar with dragon fruit flavor. More lemony tartness on the back end. A lemon rind-like bitterness lingered after the swallow.

Excellent prickly, finely beaded mouthfeel. Medium bodied for the style. The carbonation gave the beer a light and soft fluffiness on the palate.

DFPF (whatever that means) is an enjoyable and refreshing Berliner Weisse with nice fruity notes, although I definitely did not pick up much passionfruit or dragonfruit specifically. I am glad I had the opportunity to finally try this beer but, at $25 a bottle, probably would not purchase it again."
DFPF,4.39,"Pinkish magenta cloudy body with a pinkish cap. Tart and sweet passionfruit in a good berliner with notes of cracker, lemon, wheat and salt in both smell and taste. Feel is very tart and decently acidic, but it doesn't lose the script with wheat and salt making impacts. Fun and regional emphasis, refreshing even, not the most complex but it delivers what is promised"
DFPF,4.26,"On tap at Bayberry Beer Hall

Well I wasn’t expecting Bayberry to have the BA highest rated Berliner Weisse on tap for their 6th anniversary party, but I’m hyped that they do. Let’s get into it

Pours a clear ruby reddish with a finger of pinkish red head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing

Honestly the nose on this one isn’t anything too impressive. I dig it but it’s a bit sweet. I’m picking up on aromas of cherry candy, passion fruit, pineapple juice, crackery malt, lemon zest, light dragonfruit, and vanilla

Oh no, I stand corrected, that is much better in taste. Nicely tart and well balanced. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting passion fruit, underripe mango, lemon juice, apricot gummy, straw, apple cider vinegar, dragonfruit, and tart cherry. The swallow brings notes of lemon juice, pineapple juice, dragonfruit, cherry candy, crackery malt, underripe mango, and a touch of vanilla

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a a crisp beer. Finishes slightly sticky but the feel isn’t ruined by it

This is very solid stuff. It doesn’t quite live up to my expectations but it was still great to try"
DFPF,4.21,"Brewers Notes: Berliner Weisse brewed with dragon fruit and passion fruit

Saw the #1 rated Berliner Weiss at Empire Liquors! Hello? Yes please !!

Chilled clear bomber bottle to show off the big pink liquid. Ruby red liquid capped by a pink fizzy foam cap that quickly fades when poured into a schilling stemmed glass

Aroma is passion fruit ,and, I guess dragon fruit

Taste is passion fruit, tart , not too sweet , and, I guess again dragon fruit

Fizzy , sudsy mouthfeel that settles to a tart tanginess , clean,crisp, tangy

Good beer"

Everett,4.6,Best Porter I’ve ever had
Everett,4.64,"On tap at Sabatinis in Exeter pa late this afternoon.

Superb looking beer. Black body, consistent tan head, dripping rings of lacing. Aroma is strongly of chocolate malt. On tasting, slightly sweet chocolate with a hint of coffee. Smooth, excellent taste, and then the finish, which is perfect. A late roast comes in, and there is a lasting back and forth between chocolatey sweetness and a warming roast.

Overall, the best porter I've ever had in my 66 trips around the sun. Lovely beer."
Everett,4.74,"Look - Basically black with a fantastic thick foamy tan head and sticky, don't think a porter can look better
Smell - Dark Chocolate, coffee, maltiness with a hint of sweetness
Taste - dark chocolate and coffee like the smell with a slight nuttiness as well. Slightly sweet but not overly sweet at all. fantastic balance!
Feel - medium body with a medium light carb. Creamy but dry at the same time
Overall - Best Porter I've ever had, by far!"
Everett,4.8,"Draught. Basically the perfect porter. Brown, nitro-esque head. Perfect sweetness."
Everett,4.47,"Canned 12/20/22

So here we are, the highest rated American Porter on BA, the legendary Hill Farmstead Everett! This is awesome to finally get my hands on a long time want of mine, not to mention I get the pleasure of trying this just 3 days after canning. Let’s crack it open and find out what all the hype is about

Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of dark tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

Oh yeah, the nose displays such a wonderful balance between roast and sweetness, I love it. I’m picking up on aromas of medium roast coffee, milk chocolate, brown sugar, earthy hops, raisin, dark toast, light toffee, vanilla, and black pepper

It really upholds the aroma in taste, though maybe a tad less sweet. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting drip coffee, dark bread, brown sugar, honey, milk chocolate, raisin, vanilla, light caramel, and earthy hops. The swallow brings notes of milk chocolate, molasses, medium roast coffee, brown sugar, raisin, dark toast, vanilla, toffee, and earthy hops

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick yet sharp beer. Finishes bone dry and roasty

This is everything I was hoping it would be. Wonderfully balanced and smooth, yet drinks well under its abv. I’m so glad I ended up getting 8 of these"
Congress Street IPA,4.03,"Pours a pineapple juice yellow and body appears the same in the glass, opaque; thick, white head, dense and creamy throughout, rocky and sculpted; spidery webs of foam adhere to the glass. Muted yet pleasing scent of biscuit and tropical fruits. Huge biscuit malt taste with a subdued hop bitterness; suggestion of citrus pith and orange rind. Heavy body; smooth and velvety; sublime and muted dryness throughout.

This fine New England style hazy India pale ale is quite approachable. The looks are the high point. I got little in the way of fruity esters in the smell or the taste, but the taste did come across as balanced.

Congress Street IPA,4.03,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a very hazy, medium dull gold with a fine three finger white head with great retention and nice lacing. Aroma of pale malt, citrus and tropical fruit hops, lemon, grapefruit, green melon, mixed tropical fruit. Flavor is pale malt, citrus and mixed fruit hops, orange, grapefruit, mild pine, vague mixed fruit; pine resin developing into the finish but with only moderate bitterness; a little dankness in the aftertaste. Medium bodied with moderate creaminess. I picked this up, knowing it was a New England style IPA, because it is listed as Trillium's flagship American IPA. Sadly, it is in the category of mild bitterness NE style, which are not to taste. The aroma was OK, but the taste seemed subdued and muddled, with some citrus and pine, but otherwise unidentifiable juice notes that remind me of fruit juice that has set out for a while. I keep trying this style, particularly well received ones and every once in a while I find a nicely bitter one with some bright defined flavors; this was not one of them. It's satisfactory and I do appreciate the sometimes intense hop notes in these, but they seem vague to me. I see I did like Bake and Break from these guys, so I'll watch for another promising one."
Congress Street IPA,4.08,"I am trying this beer off the tapper at The Daily Growler in Powell, Ohio as part of a six sample flight. It poured a hazy golden with white head that is leaving some nice lace. The scent had great citrus peel notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with mellow semi sweet malt base with a medley of citrus fruit peel presence. The mouthfeel was medium in body and had good carbonation. Overall it is a solid beer."

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.67,"Pours black, dark tan head, absolutely gorgeous BA imperial stout. The nose features the spicy peppers, cinnamon, vanilla, cocoa, and a bit of booze. Wow.

The peppers and cinnamon are forward on the taste and AMAZING, with plenty of vanilla, cocoa, and barrel notes to provide balance and a delicious flavor profile. This is truly amazing.

The mouthfeel is rich and creamy, perfect for this beer. I’m a HUUUUGE Abraxas fan, and this is a little bit better, IMHO."
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.64,"2021 Lottery bottle. Poured at 57°. Black with ruby edges; dark tan head fizzled out quickly; poor cap retention, thin ring, a few spots of lace; thin legs on swirl. Bourbon nose with cinnamon, sweet plums and green chilies right behind; some boozy heat on the retro nasal. Taste follows nose; more sugary plums and sweet bourbon; figs, molasses and brown sugar; very light chocolate/cocoa nibs; bourbon and dark fruit finish. Hot bite on tongue from peppers and booze; full minus body, not at all adjuncty; smooth, silky feel; full mouth warmth from alcohol (13.3%) and hot peppers. Overall, loads of well balanced flavors; base and barrel merge seamlessly; long sweet bourbon and dark fruit linger leaving cinnamon and hot chilies sauce aftertaste. A sipper for sure!"
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.5,"Poured at fridge temp. Pours black as night. A minuscule layer of brown head appears and then flees. Tiny bubbles throughout.

The nose is insane. Big toffee and dark fruit. Raspberries come to mind right away, but after a few minutes that fades a bit. In comes cocoa nibs, cinnamon, coconut, vanilla, and coffee.

The taste is amazing. Coconut, vanilla, chocolate, and cinnamon are apparent. Maple syrup seems a lot stronger now. However, the cinnamon and coffee are strong. Flavors are intense.

Mouthfeel is pretty thick and the beer is clearly low in carbonation. Overall, a wonderful and intense beer!"
Affogato,4.32,"Look - black thick great big tan head that stays forever with great lacing
Smell - coffee vanilla creamy, slight chocolate
Taste - coffee vanilla chocolate slight milky
Feel - medium body and creamy
Overall - wish it had more body but otherwise pretty good"
Space Trace,3.98,"Standard understated BL 500ML bottle serving as a sleep aid, I hope. 2023 varietal.

The pour is hard black with a surprisingly active mocha head, if that does it for you.

Space Trace is solid & on-brand. Good chunk of coconut (& my favorite, little bitty witty coconutty floaties) with the quiet backing of a bourbon financier. Cocoa is understated, coming in late, adding a bit of swaggering sweetness & soft bitterness. Very smooth. I can’t taste the booze, but I can feel it. Slick. This is going down nicely.

Not the world-beater I was hoping for, but a borderline excellent example of the style. Very, very nice."
Space Trace,4.46,"500 ml bottle into a snifter. A 2023 release, had 11/11/23.

Pours near black and opaque, oily looking, with a half inch foamy head and some light oily, foamy cling. Aromas of coconut, chocolate, bourbon, oak, vanilla, cocoa. Flavors of coconut, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, cocoa, malt, light oak. Smooth, a little creamy, a very good full body, appropriately carbonated.

This is excellent. The delicious coconut is most prominent, with a good barrel presence and other expressive aromas and flavors. Would purchase again."
Space Trace,4.55,"Batch 003 (2023) ABV 12.7 %. Poured at 56°. Tight dark reddish brown head with rocks; poor cap retention leaves thin ring that quickly disappeared too; small dots of lace and tiny flecks of coconut on agitation; no legs on swirl; pruney black body with ruby edges. Nose is coconut, chocolate and bourbon, in that order; some heat n retro nasal. Entry is sweet bourbon followed by bittersweet dark chocolate a toasted coconut; oaky vanilla as beer warmed; sweetened coconut milk ending with swirls of chocolate and bourbon. Full minus body; viscous minus feel; boozy bite on tip of tongue; light carbonation; warmth in mouth from 12.7% abv; dry barrel finish. Overall an outstanding BBA coconut Imperial Stout; drinks like a coconut macaroon dipped in dark chocolate and soaked in bourbon; base, barrel and adjuncts meld seamlessly; a little on the sweet side, but the oaky barrel notes and cacao nibs keep the whole from going over the edge into cloying."

Space Trace,4.55,"Even though there seems to be fluidity in the top 250, this will be my 75th on the list. Definitely see why it is on the list. Pours dark, minimal head and lacing. Strong scents of bourbon, coconut, and chocolate. This follows to the taste, as it’s very sweet and boozy, but the flavors blend well. Big bodied, just a hint of oiliness, not thick or syrupy, but assertive alcohol burn. Really tasty."
Space Trace,4.55,"A - Pours a motor oil black with a thin tan head. Oily lacing.

S - Aroma is coconut, vanilla, dark chocolate and bourbon.

T - The taste is dark chocolate, coconut, vanilla, coffee and a nice amount of bourbon barrel.

M - Full body with medium carbonation. Chewy mouthfeel with a slick dry finish.

O - Really well done. Coconut is there, but doesn’t overpower the flavor. Good amount of barrel throughout."
Mocha Wednesday,4.37,"2021 vintage. Pours a dark brown with lots of flecks of ruby red as the light hits it; pours rather thin with a fizzy cola head that disappears quickly. Bits of carb hitting the surface. No lacing/retention. Nose is roasted coffee beans, molasses, black licorice, loose change, baking chocolate. Very little barrel character, at least initially. Kind of mind-blowing these days to have a chocolate and coffee stout that doesn't lay it on thick with raw adjunct aromas; while the coffee and chocolate are certainly there, they feel like parts of a whole that developed together, rather than some gunk that's thrown in and overpowers the product. Taste follows a similar vein - big coffee roasted coffee bean notes throughout the palate. Through its very long finish, dark chocolate and dark fruit, vanilla, smoky wood, salty black licorice, and finally, traces of warming, spicy bourbon emerge. As on the smell, a really impressive use of the adjuncts here - not at all overpowering, but still present throughout. Mouthfeel is the only real knock for me. The feel is surprisingly thin, and I think a little more body would be nice (and even expected?) given the ABV. Really worth seeking out."
Mocha Wednesday,4.45,"2016 vintage. Poured from a brown wax topped bomber into a Tree House tulip. 19.4% ABV

L: Lighter than expected pour. Medium to dark mahogany color with ruby highlights. A thin fizzy off-white head falls fast. Not much in the way of lacing.

S: Rich and boozy. BOOZE. Bourbon and vanilla... some oak, cocoa, and coffee. Mostly booze.

T.F: Sweet and rich. Boozy... as expected at 19.4%. Deliciously complex. Cocoa and coffee mixed with oak, roast, and fudge. The coffee and chocolate especially come through and are nicely complemented by the bourbon and vanilla. A little thinner than expected. Medium bodied... boozy, but not as much as the 19.4% would make you think. Still very drinkable. Low carbonation. Coffee/cocoa finish.

O: An outstanding overdone ABV stout. Great barrel character... and you get a lot of bourbon, chocolate, and coffee on this brew. Held up super well at 6+ years in the cellar. This is an all-night sipper of a beer."
Mocha Wednesday,4.49,"750 ml bottle, 2021 vintage, bottled 10/21/21, label says 19.1% ABV. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with not quite an inch tan head that fizzled away kinda quickly but leaves a small bit of head. Small amount of lacing. I like the aroma, the brew smells like bourbon, coffee, vanilla, cacao nibs and roasted malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some oak and fudge flavors noticeable too. Good amount of barrel character in both the taste and aroma. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick, rich and a bit creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation. I thought this was a pretty good brew, definitely worth picking up if you're into big barrel aged coffee stouts!"
Mocha Wednesday,4.35,"2021 edition. Coffee comes across as burnt, hides the ABV well. Tasty, but not something I'd seek out again."
Reaction State,4.7,"375ml bottle poured into a snifter
2019 Vintage

A- pours jet black in color with a one-finger dark brown foamy head that reduces to a thin ring around the edge

S- bold and rich herbal and earthy espresso notes initially, followed by dark chocolate, brownie batter and a blast of cinnamon. Undertones of the maple pop through, adding aromas of caramel and dark fruit. Light oak and creamy vanilla close out the nose, with more espresso and cinnamon sticking around, very inviting

T- bold espresso and dark chocolate brownie batter up front make for a perfect opening. Mid-palate brings out plenty of barrel, adding spicy cinnamon, oak & barrel juice. The sweet maple starts to pop out under the cinnamon whiskey, along with a creamy vanilla note to compliment. The finish gives more cinnamon & dark chocolate with a strong espresso and mocha linger

M- medium body with moderate-low carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that turns slightly creamy into a warming finish

O- every adjunct works in harmony on this one, the bold espresso and chocolate notes, along with the spicy cinnamon and sweet maple, outstanding"
Reaction State,4.9,"#150, yummy!"
Reaction State,4.5,"2022 version poured from a 16.9oz bottle into a plastic cup. My day 12 beer for Bottle Logic 12 days of Christmas. Nice thickness. Excellent blend of vanilla, maple and coffee."
Reaction State,3.5,"Cinnamon is becoming my kryptonite so I’m hoping it’s been used with an appropriately light touch in this 500ML bottle, ‘cause I like everything else added to this brute.

Hard black with a few stray brown bubbles that quiet swiftly. Oh Oh. Cinnamon bite is strong on the nose. Please, no, brew deities.

Reaction State tiptoes along the abyss of cinnamon gorge. Cinnamon is straddling the beer but doesn’t quite crush it into submission. Underneath the spice are touches of maple, vanilla, & the ghost of cocoas past. Light bourbon winds its way betwixt & between & the finish is mulled apple cider. Should have split this one with my wife.

Hey brewers: quit putting so much fucking cinnamon in your beers. If you can’t get the balance right, throw the crap away. Pretty good beer, which is sad, as I can sense something really good underneath the cinnamon avalanche."
Reaction State,4.57,"Pours a dark brown like motor oil. Just a half of a finger of dark brown head shows up and disappears just as quickly.

Nose is a walloping of bourbon barrel aged stout. Its got that rich, dense, still wet barrel level of intensity. Huge oak profile. I love it. Next is the roasted malt and a strong presence of chocolate. This reminds me a little of one of my favorites of all time; Weyerbacher's Chocolate Pretzel Sunday Morning Stout. Then in the background, there lies the cinnamon.

Taste is much of the same on the nose. Oak, bourbon, roasted malt, chocolate, cinnamon. But now I get the slight bit of maple syrup. Maple syrup presents almost with, I hesitate to say this, but a sour note when its put in stouts sometimes. Like an extremely subtle tartness or tanginess. It doesn't detract, but it is a unique quality. The tannins from the barrel kind of leave that soapy flavor that also sometimes tends to happen in these barrel aged stouts. Its incredibly mild and doesn't linger, but thats why I decided to put it at a 4.5 rather than 4.75, similar to the nose.

Mouthfeel is fullbodied and smooth. Brief flash of carbonation right at the beginning. ABV makes its presence known, but not as severely as that Maumasi I had the other night. There is a little bit of drying but not harsh on the palate or on the way down.

Overall my favorite Bottle Logic brew so far. I was surprised because I though this was just going to be another ""breakfast stout"", but this one actually blew me away. Well balanced and all the flavors work well with each other and don't feel like novelty additions. Masterclass level stuff."
Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.43,"Delicious on tap at brewery.
Angry Chair loves to create cake flavors and this one is ultra delicious! Love the blend of all flavors and reminds me of homemade German chocolate cake."
Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,2.95,"L -- Probably the most filled to the brim can I've ever opened. Pours a deep black with a fizzy carbonation and a scant tan head produced with moderately aerated pour. Everything dissipates pretty quickly. Looks almost like a glass of coke
S -- Vanilla, milk chocolate, white chocolate, coconut candy, butterscotch, malted milk ball, maple sugar, cake batter, graham cracker. The high point of this brew
T -- Hershey syrup, vanilla frosting, almond joy bar, coffee syrup, and a hint of roast. As can be surmised, it's very sweet. Malt bill reminds me a lot of the Tree House milk stout lineup
F -- The fizziness noted in the appearance is also evident here. Surprisingly thin for the ABV
O -- Not quite the caliber I was expecting, but this definitely does serve as a good example of the sweet, adjunct-laden milk stouts currently being produced by many of the leading US brewers

60/100"
Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.57,"Having taken a considerable break in the craft beer realm this is a great brew amongst the expanse.

The look is nice. Doesn't look like sludge which is remarkable considering the ingredients. Smooth looking, with a nice finger of khaki foam.

Nose is actually incredible. Its like I'm smelling a fresh baked chocolate cupcake. The coconut is faint, the chocolate is dominant, the pastry aspect is present and they all work together quite brillaintly.

Taste follows similarly. Anybody who nosed this knew this would be sweet. Chocolate is gracious, coconut adds that unique tropical or perhaps slight nutty element. The vanilla persists throughout. This is a pastry stout done right. Not overbearing, not sickening, just right.

Mouthfeel is silky smooth. Dense and cloying. If sipped slowly this is an amazing 1 hour burn of a brew. Maybe an everything pretzel crisp or two for those who are wanting to cut some of the sweetness.

This is a well done pastry stout. Like, really well done. But still, this is not for everybody. If you are not a fan of these, a contrast is probably in order. Perhaps a dark bread or a bit of sharp cheese. Or maybe as a digestif with friends after a particularly savory meal.

Well done Angry Chair."
Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.46,"16oz can. No dating information found, and the label recommends to ""DRINK FRESH"".
Impenetrable, black colored body. Short lived mocha brown head, leads to a mild surface storm and thin ring building.
Aroma is German chocolate cake, with sweet vanilla and coconut.
Taste is richly sweet, with flavors of chocolate infused raisins and prunes. Sweet vanilla and coconut emerge mid to late.
Chocolate syrup mouthfeel. Higher ABV% is warming but well hidden. Quiet carbonation.
Very good rendition of German Chocolate Cake."
Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.44,"Very happy to find this on the shelf. I have wanted to try it for years.

Pours very low carb with very little to no head. Black a little bit oily appearance.

Nose is coconut. Chocolate. Vanilla. Taste follows the nose.

Moderate bodied for the style."
Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.26,"Pitch black body with a pinky finger of light brown foam. Smell and taste are clones: big coconut burst to start, followed by huge vanilla before baker's chocolate, lactose, and malt round out. Feel is sugary on the finish, but very smooth and cohesive in bring it all together, cool and dark in the heavier body. Did not meet the hype, but a good dessert stout nonetheless"
Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.46,"Pours pitch black. Dense. Aroma is intense sweetness. Dominated by cocoa, chocolate & vanilla. Taste follows nose with a hint of coconut. Medium body. Great stout."
KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,4.59,"Review: 2152
Name: KBS Maple Mackinac Fudge
Brewery: Founders Brewing
Location: Grand Rapids, MI
Style: Barrel-Aged Imperial Stout
ABV: 11%
Date: 10/26/2020
Continuing to work through my Founder's Collection, I am sipping on a KBS variant. I am still determining how to pronounce Mackinac, but it is a maple fudge variant. I am using a tulip glass and serving the beer at 48 degrees. The pour created a frothy, creamy, one-fingered dark tan head with okay retention. The somewhat quick dissipation left no lacing on the glass. I am charting the beer at SRM 38, which is inky black and opaque. The appearance is average for this style; I have seen longer-lasting heads on Imperial Stouts.
Nosing the glass, I smell rich chocolate fudge, bourbon, coffee, malty sweetness, and bits of dankness. The fudge aromas resemble grandma's fudge she makes during the holidays. The fudge has a milk chocolate quality with a hint of dark, bittersweet baking chocolate and sugary. The coffee aroma is medium-roasted with a bit of wood and bitterness. The malt profile is roasty with char, subtle smoke, toasted cereal, and bready. The barrel aging added the need for complexity to round out the dominant aromas. The barrel added bourbon, oak, and caramel notes. Other scents I smell are toffee, molasses, figs, floral, a hint of dankness, tobacco, and vanilla. The beer has a delightful bouquet of aromas.
I was concerned that this beer would be a sugar bomb, but I was pleasantly surprised. This beer is fantastic. The Fudge flavor is a bright, shining star, with a cadre of flavors filling the crucial roles needed to make this beer shine. The fudge is oozing chocolate flavors of milk chocolate and dark Belgian Chocolate. The barrel aging added a lovely depth with char notes, bourbon, and oak. The malt backbone is firm with flavors of roast and toasty cereal grains, bready, light smoke, and a skosh of Maillard. The other part of that cadre is the coffee. Mackinac Fudge has a fantastic coffee flavor: slightly bitter, medium-roasted, and earthy. The rest of the flavors are molasses, toffee, caramel, raisin, and a light floral finish. I did not mention the maple in the aromas or taste because I had difficulty discerning that flavor; the Chocolate was substantial.
The mouthfeel is chewy and creamy, and the finish is smooth yet bitter. The body is heavy and has low carbonation.
I enjoy this beer, and I am glad it is not a sugar bomb. However, I was disappointed that I could not smell or taste the maple; I think the chocolate-dominated flavor hid that—a fantastic sipper for the night. I will try another variant soon."
KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,4.75,"Look is dark black. Smell is chocolate and bourbon. Taste is chocolate, bourbon, and dark malt. Feel is thick and full bodied. Great dessert beer perfect for a cold winter night."
KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,3.83,"12 oz bottle acclimated to 50°F and poured into a stout glass.

Pours impenetrable black, with a 0.5 finger, long lasting, sudsy, British khaki head, leaving light splotches of lacing.

Initial aroma is seriously thick, and very heavy on booze, it smells a lot like a sweet alcohol. I pick up some maple, but I'm not sure I would have had I not known what it was. It's very sweet and sticky smelling, and there's maybe a hint of vanilla, though that could be the booziness.

After agitating it remains the same, though slightly more alcohol.

Initial taste before swallowing is powerful, it's got some bitterness to it but it's got sweetness behind it. There's a smoky char to it that I really enjoy.

After swallowing I first get bitter cocoa powder. A strong char develops and lasts a good while, lasting into the finish where it mellows quite a bit and takes on a slightly metallic quality. All the whole sweetness lurks behind any foreground taste. I can really taste the alcohol after a few tastes and it's not incredible, not exactly bad but I don't quite love it, and I am a fan of high alcohol beer."
KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,4.08,"Pours a dark brown color with ruby edges and a half finger of tan head. The nose is all fudge upfront with maple syrup notes on the back end. The only bummer is that the barrel notes are pretty weak. The flavor follows the nose but everything seems muted compared to the potent smell of this offering.

This is a fine variant but it is not exceptional."
KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,4.02,"Smells like maple syrup, chocolate and coffee! Tastes like chocolate and some coffee. Maybe very faint syrup taste. Aug 22 bottling date. I think the 3rd stout I’ve had to date. Maybe not my thing?"
Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.29,"Appearance -The beer was a slick black color with a slight head.

Smell - The nose with lightly boozy with notes of chocolate.

Taste - The profile was a very chocolate forward with notes of anise And Bourbon. Accompanying, notes included cherry, currants, and licorice. There was not much heat from the barrel. Even with a thinner body, this one is a sipper.

Mouthfeel - Perhaps because I am spoiled with bigger bodies on other stouts, this seemed a bit thin.

Overall - For my money, this beer seemed to be a bit overrated because of where it came from."
Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.5,"Jet black pour with a mocha head--really pretty. Nice silky mouthfeel and very smooth. I had the 2018 vintage on the first day of Spring (it was snowing outside) in March 2024. The years served to mellow and smooth this Russian Imp Stout, but still there were both sweet (chocolate) and bitter (herbal) flavors present. Bit of a bite, but mostly silky despite its high octane. Lovely brew."
Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.41,"Bottled on January 10th, 2020.

This is a nice looking beer both on the pour from the bottle and in the glass. The color is like pretty much every other stout, but that's not a bad thing. There's a thin, short-lived head along with really, really nice legs.

Aroma is wonderful in its simplicity with notes of bourbon barrel and malty sweetness. Very enticing.

The taste closely follows the nose. Roasted malts, just enough sweetness, and some nice charred oak. Once again, the beauty is in the simplicity. This is isn't loaded with adjuncts, it's just a very well made imperial stout. I'm particularly enjoying the full body and the nice roasted notes on the long finish.

Overall, excellent."
Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.9,",#171, fantastic!"
Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.24,"2020 vintage. A very solid and canonical example of the style, perhaps *the* prototype of what a bourbon barrel aged RIS should emulate. I find the style to be a little bit on the roasty, herbaceous side and this was no exception. The barrel aging did smooth things out quite a bit in the flavors, although I was surprised that the mouthfeel wasn't fuller. Overall very glad to finally try this but I definitely prefer Beyond Good and Evil, and their other sweeter BBA stouts

I just got a job offer today, so I needed to pull something out of my cellar to celebrate. I traded a bottle of EH Taylor small batch for this bottle of beer, so let's see if it lives up the hype and $50 I paid for the bourbon. It does look spot on amazing. It's super thick but not syrupy in a bad way. This is the kind of stout that beginners would hate and neck bearded beer nerds crave. On the tongue it's super full and soft. Absolutely perfect for the style for me. I'm not getting enough on the nose though to wow me. I get bourbon and chocolate. I smell the typical lovely bitterness of a RIS. Still, it's lacking in the nose for me. Drinking it though everything lives up to the hype. It's less sweet than a typical Goose BCS which set the standard for me back in the day. I can taste the booziness but in a good way. I like high abv stouts where I can taste the alcohol a bit. Why make a bourbon barrel aged stout if the bourbon isn't front and center? What's different and great is that there's also the balance of the base beer. There's a lot of plain old RIS here. Take your best like a Darkness or Expedition and add the bourbon with everything balancing out perfectly. The finish is long and toasty like a good cup of coffee. A great beer and worth the bourbon (at retail.)"
Double Stack,4.35,"Pours a dark brown with a small short-lived head and little lacing.

Smells of toasted malt and coffee.

Tastes of sweet , toasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate and maple with a slightly bitter boozy warm finish.

Medium heavy body with very light carbonation. Lush and syrupy mouthfeel.

This one a big, sweet and strong sipper."
Double Stack,4.15,"Deep, dark brown pour, opaque pour and in the glass; thick, tan head, rich and sudsy, very long lasting. Excellent dark roasted grain scent with elements of maple syrup and coffee grounds; a french toast note emerges as the beer warms. Heavy sweetness in the taste; bitter and milk chocolate and maple syrup; very strong coffee bitterness, espresso-like; interesting interplay between the coffee bitterness and alcohol presence. Heavy body; velvety; lip-smacking stickiness.

With no canning info, it's difficult to say when this beer was canned. The maple syrup presence takes a back seat to the coffee bean character. All in all, a very nice imperial breakfast stout.

ABV: 11.0%; pouring temperature: 39 °F; canning info: n/a

Double Stack,4.45,"On tap at Great Notion Alberta. Poured an opaque, jet-black color with a small, light brown head of foam. It left sudsy lacing. It smelled of roasted coffee, maple syrup, chocolate and vanilla. Sweet maple taste with bitter roasted coffee, rich chocolate and toffee."
Double Stack,4.42,"This beer is pretty perfectly what it advertises to be: an imperial maple coffee stout.

Quite sweet, but neither over the top nor artificial-tasting. The coffee is noticeable but not overwhelming, and complements the roastiness of the base beer. Just a hint of banana, likely from the yeast, and primarily on the nose. Minor notes of caramel and chocolate.

This isn't a particularly complex or crazy beer, but as I stated up top, it's exactly what it should be - and most importantly, it's delicious!"
Double Stack,4.34,"Dark brown, almost black color. Aroma is a grill full of pancakes along with a hit of coffee. Low head, rapidly vanishing head. Taste is getting some of those pancakes along with maple syrup and a mug of hot coffee. Long finish, smooth to the end. The 11% ABV does put an alcohol burn on the tongue. All together, makes for a very interesting experience."
Double Stack,4.19,"Nose gives you plenty of the promised coffee and maple, and gives you that ""ooh this is going to be good"" feeling deep down inside. Flavor is a bit too sweet imo, although it does deliver on those coffee/maple notes alongside the thick stout. Mouthfeel is both creamy and a little cloying so good and some meh there. Overall an enjoyable beer, but you need to be in the mood for this specifically."
Double Stack,4.24,"Look: Pours a thick black color, with a light creamy head that all but disappeared except around the rim.

Smell: Has a heavy coffee bean scent, with a hint of cacao and just a bit of maple syrup. Perhaps a bit heavy on the coffee side for my preference.

Taste: Mostly coffee, a bit on the bitter side. I'm not really getting much maple syrup flavor to sweeten things up a bit, which I think I'd like more of. My friend who tasted this with me agrees.

Feel: Creamy, perfectly carbonated, goes down very smoothly.

Overall: This is a good stout, but to me it had a bit too much coffee bitterness and not enough maple syrup sweetness for my personal liking."
Double Stack,3.94,"The beer with the closest profile I'm familiar with is Mornin' Delight -- mostly through this very distinctive, semi-artificial maple aroma and flavor. The coffee is a little bolder and darker in this one, and the mouthfeel and appearance are definitely less thick. Overall it's pretty good but, like the majority of Great Notion's offerings, a bit gimmicky

79/100"
Double Stack,4.34,"Picked up a 16 oz single from GB's Bottle Shop in Orlando 1-27-24 i think for $8.99. No canning date; consumed 1-27-24.

Beer poured black with a very nice tan head.

Nose is very nice with a beautiful combination of coffee and maple.

Taste is very well done as a large malt base gives notes of mild roast and a touch of chocolate. The coffee and maple adjuncts are woven in very well. Finishes just a tad sweet but definitely not cloying.

Mouthfeel is medium to large bodied and very smooth.

Overall a delicious brew, glad i was able to give it a try!"
Double Stack,4.36,"Look: Pours like motor oil and black as night with a quick-forming brown head that rises and slowly settles to a silky-looking lid, leaving minimal lacing behind
Aroma: Roasted tree nuts, roasted barley, bakers cocoa, maple syrup, cold-brewed coffee, caramel, light earthy notes, piloncillo, and warm brown bread. No alcohol heat detectable
Taste: Whoa. Opens up with a rush of roast, roasted barley, and cocoa that sucker punches the palate before mellowing some and developing depth. Waves of coffee, maple syrup, and tree nuts crash in to join, each shining for a moment on their own before blending into the mix nicely. Earthiness and piloncillo peek in from time to time throughout and closes with chocolate, coffee, brown bread, and maple syrup, along with just a kiss of ethanol
Mouthfeel: Full, silky smooth, medium carbonation, and smooth and full on the finish with a touch of dryness
Overall: This is some tasty stuff. I’ve wanted to try this for a couple years now but hadn’t fully committed to buying it until now as it looked to be odd and unique but maybe not good enough to warrant a full serving which, as I now can say, it is. This reminds me a lot of a bourbon barrel aged Imperial Stout except with the bourbon swapped out for maple syrup and coffee and it isn’t too one-sided nor overly sweet enough for me to only want a few sips. Super fun to try and drink, plus a sneakily hidden 11% ABV. Definitely worth trying to those who think they would be into it as it made a believer in the hype out of me"
Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,5.0,Seriously smooth DIPA! Citra citra citra! Served from a 16 Oz can bought from brewery in Manhattan. Pours a pale yellow with minimal head.

So good it’s all year round in New York.
Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,4.46,"Description: Pale yellow color, sort of like pineapple juice and cloudy with a small amount of white head and lacing. Citrus is very apparent on the nose and blended nicely with melon, papaya and dank, ripe fruit. The taste is well balanced and fruit forward with many similar notes to the aroma with dank, citrus flavors finishing in bitter grapefruit. Very flavorful. The feel is medium with high carbonation and a dry finish.

Overall: 4.5 (This beer is very good and I would definitely drink it again) Loads of citrus flavor without being muddled, this is a very well balanced brew that's one to try."

Feel- Medium body, average carbonation, mildly sweet, between mild and moderate bitterness, mild astringency, mildly prickly, mildly dry finish.

Overall- Great appearance with plenty of haze and above average head retention and lacing. Nose was clementine forward, but had some balance with notes of strawberry and pear with adequate strength. Flavor was dominated by clementine and pith with a weaker than average strength. Feel consisted of a medium body with some mild astringency and a mildly dry finish. Overall I had much higher hopes for this beer. It delivered an average drinking experience."
Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,4.4,"Taste follows nose. Nice foamy head and delicious tropical flavors.
While excellent, there are lots of Other Half DIPAs I prefer."
Thicket,2.93,"While lovely in appearance akin to a nice burgundy wine, and with expressive aromas of fresh picked blackberry, the taste once again falls flat with Side Project's wild ales. Basically carbonated vinegar, with a hint of blackberry in the background. I guess I see the appeal, but it does not come across as particularly well executed. Just loads of lactobacillus without a discernible terroir

< 60/100"
Thicket,4.44,"Appearance - The beer was reddish purple in color, with light carbonation noted.

Smell - The nose was like sweet blackberry jam. There was little sourness in the nose.

Taste - In the initial taste, there was tons of blackberry. It was like blackberry jam, but progressively more sour toward the finish. There was a hint of funk before a lingering tart dry finish.

Mouthfeel - The body was a bit sticky with light carbonation. The dry finish clung to the roof of the mouth.

Overall - This was a very accessible, even for those that don’t like sours."
Thicket,4.24,"Blend #1, on tap at the cellar. Nice and tart. Just funky enough. Wine barrels did this well. Quite enjoyable. Would really like to contract with Blend #2 eventually."
Jammy,4.67,"Look - reddish auburn slightly haze with a nice big slightly pinkish white head and sticky
Smell - tart funky blackberry jam with a nice woodiness.
Feel - medium full body with a fizzy medium carb tang
Overall - outstanding"
Jammy,4.33,"Appearance - The beer poured a reddish purple color with a bubbly white head.

Smell - The is a jam presence in the nose. It was sweet, but tart.

Taste - Underripe blackberries led the way before green apples. This beer was quite sour. It drank more like a sour than a farmhouse.

Mouthfeel - The feel became quite dry in the aftertaste. The carbonation was somewhat weak.

Mouthfeel - I wanted more farmhouse funk."
Hold On To Sunshine,4.13,"The only knock, for me, is the peanut flavor. I love peanut’s with my beer, just not brewed in it."
Hold On To Sunshine,4.48,"Poured from a pint can, a coffee black body with a mocha brown head. Light lacing throughout the tasting.

Aroma is a delightful sweet coffee and chocolate with a wee hint of peanut.

Taste follows nose and adds a slightly fuller peanut flavor that pairs well with the milk chocolate and coffee flavors. The latter is more assertive in taste: bold, roasty flavor. The lactose flavor is present but it stays in the background and is subservient and complimentary to the other flavors.

Mouthfeel is creamy with solid carbonation."
Hold On To Sunshine,4.52,"Look - Black with just a fantastic thick tan head and great rimming and lacing
Smell - Roasted Coffee, Chocolate, Caramel, and slight Peanut Butter
Taste - Chocolate and Peanut Butter stand out first, followed by the roasted coffee, caramel, and vanilla. Really blends well without being overlly sweet
Feel - Full, thick and creamy. Lighter carb with a slight crispness to it
Overall - Really fantastic. I'm not usually a fan of PB stouts but this one just kills it!"
Hold On To Sunshine,4.42,Super tasty very dark desert beer. Very thick and a bit overpowering so one will do it.
Hold On To Sunshine,4.0,"Can from Jeff, thanks for the hookup!
Inky black with a huge frothy creamy light tan head that slowly recedes. Rich milk chocolate and creamed coffee with bits of licorice and dark fruits. Pretty nice!"
Hold On To Sunshine,4.56,"Poured from 16oz can into pint glass in February 2023, that I purchased at their brewery in Charlton, MA. There is a date of Winter 2023 on the bottom of the can, and I drank this about 1 month after I purchased it.

Appearance: Very dark black with 1-finger head. The head was dark brown, and disappeared after a minute. It left only a little lacing on the glass, and no head remained after a minute.

Smell: Strong mix of aromas filled the room as soon as the can was opened. Roasted coffee, caramel, and chocolate aromas. Not much hop style citrus or pine aromas.

Taste: There is taste of coffee, chocolate, and licorice. Also, some vanilla, peanut butter, and roasted malt flavors. They are more balanced than I expected from the aroma. Flavors are very bold. There is a strong alcohol presence that matches 7.6% advertised. A sweet chocolate, and vanilla aftertaste with edge of coffee, that is really enjoyable.

Mouth-feel: Very thick, but with an extremely smooth and creamy body.

This is a very good Porter, and one of the best Porters I have ever drank. It has a variety of flavors that adds a nice complexity to the beer. The balance of flavors is outstanding. The flavors of coffee and roasted malt nicely balance the bitter coffee with the sweet chocolate and caramel flavors. This is even better than the Tree House Cartharsis Porter, which is very good. This is very smooth and enjoyable to drink. I have enjoyed all the beers I've bought at Tree House, and I would buy this again."
Hold On To Sunshine,4.08,"Dark brown with a half finger of audibly fizzy dark khaki head that quickly settles into a lasting crown. No real lacing.

Roast peanuts, peanut butter, roasted malt and quality breakfast blend coffee in the aroma.

The taste spotlights peanut butter, very light chocolate and caramel and some roastiness from the complementary coffee.

Creamy, full bodied feel with a mouth-coating oiliness and light zip to the carbonation.

Peanut beers aren’t my thing, but this is a very nicely made one."
Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,4.41,"22 oz bomber (2015)

A- Pours pitch black with a thin mocha colored head. Minimal lacing throughout.

S- Dark chocolate comes through immediately with undertones of vanilla. There is a light undercurrent of cinnamon wafting in the background. I take an extra strength whiff (for science) and only then can I start picking up some stale, oxidation characteristics. It is nearly imperceptible and has no real impact.

T- Following closely from the nose, the flavor starts off with smooth dark chocolate dominating at first, with the vanilla providing ample support. As the beer warms to room temperature, the cinnamon starts its move from the periphery to becoming a more integral component. Cinnamon is something which can easily be off putting to me in larger doses but here it is well integrated and nicely complements the stronger chocolate and vanilla flavors. No perceptible heat or spiciness to me from the chile peppers. It's quite possible this aspect has faded over time. I do think there are some remnants adding to the total flavor profile but I'm just not able to easily pick them out. The only slight knock I can give is that the barrel characteristics are minimal.

M - Slightly oily with a medium body. Carbonation (medium) has held up quite well.

O - For whatever reason, I had low expectations going in for this beer after being cellared for six years. However, it has held up remarkably well in that time. I regrettably did not have this beer when it was released so cannot give any comparison. On its own, it's a delicious beer."

Popinski - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Peanut Butter And Marshmallow,5.0,"First of all, the smell. I could sit all day with the glass to my nose and just smell this all day. Thick mouthfeel. Very very tasty. Just a great dessert stout!"
Starry Noche,3.38,"2023 Vintage

Syrup in the glass with no head. Sweet fudge, bourbon-soaked dark fruits, and sweet confection throughout. Mouth-coating and velvety. Cloyingly sweet, but there's some complexity to the sweetness"

A medium bodied well carbonated beer
An well balanced stout"
Leche Borracho,4.9,"#178, good stuff!"
Magnus,4.5,2023 version poured from a 6.3oz bottle into a tiny snifter. Above average thickness. Lightly sweet. Pretty solid.
Magnus,5.0,Very luscious and complex beer. Great body with a fantastic taste an aroma. Very delightful to drink.
Crusher,4.49,"Pours a murky amber with a full head that slowly dissipates to a thin raft of bubbles. Smell is of lemon with a hint of orange rind along with some herbal notes. Taste is aggressively bitter at first, but that bitterness is quickly overtaken by the fruitiness. As that fades, the bitterness comes back in the aftertaste as faint grapefruit rind. Mouthfeel is interesting - it feels creamy at first, but slips easily down, leaving that mouth-watering rindy finish.

I think I can taste a little of the weed flavor that's in Heady, but here it takes a backseat to the fruit.

Overall a very impressive DIPA - a rare (and perfectly executed) combination of West Coast bitterness with NEIPA fruit. The alcohol is well hidden too.

Update--- A month on, and the beer has gone up in my estimation. The first time I tried it, it tasted like an an Alchemist IPA with the bitterness dialed back a little. Now it tastes like a NEIPA with a reasonable amount of bitterness, which is (somewhat ironically) the sweet spot for me, occupied by beers like Fiddlehead IPA and Tree House Green."
Crusher,3.91,Underwhelming.
Crusher,4.46,"(16 oz can, Canned on: 04-09-24; purchased cold 4-pack from the brewery two days ago... poured into my Trillium fat tulip)

L: cloudy, murky liquid out of the can; opaque golden amber hue... managed to get almost two-finger high foam; it's a tight sponge in the middle, more open around the perimeter... maintains a misty cap, but laces little

S: white grapefruit, orange rind, lemon muffin at first... after a few measures, some pan citrus flesh and fresh cut grass emerge... it settles out to mushed grapefruits and couch wool... good potency, short on dimension

T: spicy resins punch hard up the middle, peppery through the aftertaste, propelled by the buried booze... perhaps a faint mango tropical undertone... am I detecting some twinkles of fried rice and duck sauce?... floral-kissed, dry citrus pixi stix

F: light-bodied to a degree, just fluffy with inflated hopped foam, spreading powdery slime across the palate... miraculous absence of sludge... saturating and sedating the senses up front while it's fireball dry spice in the afterburn... perhaps the best textures for the style I've encountered

O: it's a solid NEIPA of sorts - one that has some fruitiness, but also has significant contrast (and arguably dominance) from spicy, vaguely herbal, and very green hop character as well... this might actually be a NEIPA I would purposefully buy in the future (2286)"
Crusher,4.24,"Poured into a wide mouth grip shaped goblet: color is straw gold, hazy/murky, head is brighter white and presents one finger thick, some spots on the glass sides.

Smell is dank, sweet candied notes, light onion/grass, toasted malt, citrus, some pine, earth.

Taste is similar with candied hops, dank, citrus, pine, grass, earth, malt and light toast.

Mouthfeel is lower carbonation, moderate sweetness, moderate bitterness.

Overall a very good hazy, more bitter DIPA - great hop aroma/flavor depth and solid bitterness to back the sweetness."
Crusher,4.55,"Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Canned June 21st 2023.

Hazed and opaque body with a muted orange but fairly dark and still. A mix of custard but has a much darker than expected color. The beer nearly appears frozen. Head is quite soapy, fine white bubbles of three fingers with light retention. Shampoo like top but lots of ring lacing to match.

Aroma is a hop surprise. Hints of soft dank, but a real gumdrop like candy sweetness that matches nicely. Thick and rich, with a light sense of sweet malt to counter as well. The contrast between dank and sweet hop aroma on this is exceptional. Huge juicy dank sweet punch is the only way I can describe it, like hop thick Kool-Aid.

Palate brings things a little more into focus, but does not hold back. Mid palate hits with a hot but delicious earthy mid palate punch. Large and bold, but controlled hop blasts of pine, earth, juiced candy orange pineapple and mango rolling into a minty finish that just does not quit. It doesn't stop there, with a creamed earthy mouthfeel that feels like a sundae, and smells like sweet tilled garden earth.

A bit of a punishing sensation, but in a real good way, Crushing indeed."
Crusher,4.98,"This is one of the most underrated IPAs out there. Great balance, hop bitterness and malt. No pun intended, but it Crushes it."
Crusher,4.9,"#154, crushable for sure!"
Crusher,4.53,Nice beer. More bitter than Heady or Focal but not overwhelming. To me this tastes more like a west coast DIPA. Not sure if the ABV is off on these but a little goes a long way--these can really sneak up on you.
Crusher,4.68,"A-Pillowy white head on top of a hazy bright yellow beer
S-Pine forward dank layered upon a malt base of simple light syrup and caramel
M-Dry finish for sure with low end carbonation
T-Earthy pine with a dank twinge and complex flavours that are almost savoury.
O-Quite the conundrum of a brew, very west coast old school IPA, with the bitter notes playing a leading role"
Crusher,4.23,"Poured from a can with no visible date into a teku. Can purchased on 8/15/22 from The Alchemist.

L- Beautiful opaque deep golden color.

S- Some “Dank” along with a hint of pine.

T- Up front piney bite, but not
overpowering.

F- Moderate carbonation , dry finish.

O- A fantastic DIPA! Not too sweet and
juicy, not too resiny. Just perfect!"
Arthur Puncheon,4.59,"Appearance - The beer was straw yellow with visible carbonation.

Smell - The nose had bitter lemon and bitter funk.

Taste - The profile had an excellent dry funk. Lemon peel, papaya, and fresh cut grass notes followed. The finish kept strong lemon notes and Earthiness.

Mouthfeel - The body was light and bubbly with some stickiness.

Overall - I only wish the bottle was bigger."
Arthur Puncheon,5.0,One of my favorite beers from Hill Farmstead. Nice taste and great look. Perfect funk and smooth. Smells great and is nothing like regular Arthur.
Arthur Puncheon,4.27,"Look - Clear yellow with a white head and nice rimming
Smell and Taste - great earthy oaky floral with a slight tartness
Feel - dry medium body with a light carb
Overall - really nice!"
Arthur Puncheon,4.64,"Drank 02.18.24 out of an oversized Hill Farmstead wine glass, Bottled June 25, 2019, drank in about 45 minutes, just couldn't slow down. One of the tastiest Hill Farmstead beers I've ever had...so damn good!"
Arthur Puncheon,4.2,Decent beer - a bit tart for my own personal taste.
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.0,"Review: 2194
Name: Apple Brandy Barrel Noir
Brewery: Prairie Artisan Ales
Location: Krebs, OK
Style: Barrel-Aged Imperial Stout
ABV: 12%
Date: Unknown
I am shifting to an imperial barrel-aged beer from Oklahoma: Apple Brandy. My brief knowledge of Apple Brandy is that it is a brandy made from apples. I have tried this before, and it has a faint hint of apples. It was distilled to create the brandy. I am still determining if brandy will push through the imperial stout. I am using a tulip glass and serving the beer at 48 degrees. The pour created a creamy, one-fingered, medium-tan head with poor retention. The quick dissipation left no lacing on the glass. The jet-black beer has dark mahogany hues, is charting at SRM 38, and is opaque. The appearance is average for this style.
That is interesting. When I first nosed the glass, the beer had a faint apple aroma, along with alcohol, chocolate, oak, and coffee. Nosing the glass several times, I detect bread, roasty, lightly toasted malts, molasses, earthy, light smoke, char, raisins, and floral. The beer has a lovely malt complex accompanied by a heavy barrel aging. I was expecting an elaborate nose, but it is straightforward.
The beer did not hold up in the cellar; it was vinegar. I am going to close this review and give the beer an average rating, and I will come back to it if I can get a hold of another one. I did not detect the vinegar in the nose, and when I sipped the beer, I was stunned and said, "" it has turned."
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.75,"2016 Vintage(I Think)

A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer which is topped by a small light tan head which fades quickly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing
S: Smells of brandy barrels with some chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts
T: Taste is chocolate and coffee up front with some brandy barrel influence. Hints of roasted malts and toasted marshmallows. On the swallow there's more brandy barrel, chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts
M: This beer has a body which is lighter than anticipated and slightly silky. Carbonation is quite low, but it is there while the beer has a sightly drying finish due to the ABV
O: Overall this beer is quite good. It has also held up well over time. Complexity also grows as the beer warms. It's definitely worth a try if you like barrel aged beers."
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.9,"#105 Love it, Apple really come thru!"
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.26,"Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is good after an aggressive pour. Aroma is big. Apple brandy, toffee, barrel, char, and caramel dance and play over roasty and toasty malts. Flavor profile is medium-thin. Roasty and toasty malts lead the charge. Toffee, caramel, molasses, and apple brandy tag on for a flavorful brew. Mouth feel is velvety, and soft, but never hits creamy. It has a medium-thick consistency. Overall, solid stout with hints of apple brandy coming through.

Reviewed from notes. Reviewed 1/12/19. 2018 version."
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.5,"Really enjoying this. Much less sweet than anticipated and has a nice chally bakers chocolage predominace. The apple brandy tastes genuine and natural whereas I feel I lot of prairies beers are try hard and artificial. Namely vanilla noir which is awfully fake.

Its not terribly complex. Taste like a very simple, basic, strong old school RIS with roasty notes layered with oak and yesz apple bransy. Quite thick and very hot."
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.79,This rating is based on the original from a few years ago. Pours dark brown/black with exceptional thickness. The Apple Brandy melds perfectly to make this an exceptional barrel aged stout. For a number of years this was my favorite beer.
No Rules,4.44,"Black in color with no light penetration. Fingernail of brown around the rim and covering half of the top. Moderate, soapy lacing. I smell milk chocolate, coconut, and bourbon. I’m tasting dark chocolate, bourbon, and coconut. It’s deceptively silky smooth for the ABV."
No Rules,4.53,"Yellow bowling ball I think means 2019. Tried in January 2023. Very boozy nose. Head was tan. Pour was darker than most porters, but don't let that scare you :) Taste is chocolate with coconut on the backend. While this is 15% it is a very smooth drinking beer. Well done!"
No Rules,4.25,"2021 on draft.

Pours a pitch black. Swirling gives way to thick oily alcohol legs, almost like what you would get swirling a dram of bourbon. Not much head, as expected for 15% but a pencil lead thin ring the color of hot chocolate sticks around for the entirety.

Nose is earthy sugarcane, burnt brown sugar, molasses, toffee, some cinnamon, and vanilla

Taste follows suit with the addition of barrel notes, however subtle. This doesn’t drink like 15%. Very easy drinking, oily, smooth, and full. Excellent example of the style and an over expression of what can be done with it. Glad to have finally tried it. Cheers."
No Rules,4.31,"draught
This is a 2019 Vietnamese barrel aged version.
Quite, quite dark brown, with a thin beige head. No light transmission here. Sweet bourbon and molasses, with some toasted coconut and toffee, in the smell. Slightly syrupy malt, toasted coconut and a bit of spiced toffee, in the taste, with a tiny bite that lingers awhile. Finish is a sweet dark malt and bourbon flavor."
Insert Hip Hop Reference There,4.52,This is a great IPA. Bursting with cirtus flavor - super smooth with a nicy hoppy backbone and incredible mouthfeel. One of the best IPAs I've had in recent memory that wasn't from Fiden's or Root+Branch.
Insert Hip Hop Reference There,4.64,"This is a great tasting IPA. Nice Citra flavor, nice mouth feel and definitely hoppy. It's a triple, so the hoppiness is to be expected. The mouth feel is very good, but not the best I have had. Definitely a world class beer! Nice job!"
Insert Hip Hop Reference There,3.09,Sweeter than a pastry stout
Barrel Aged Bomb!,4.21,"Appearance - The beer was deep black in appearance with tan bubbles crowning the pour.

Smell - Chocolate and cinnamon were the most prominent notes. It did not seem to have a lot of heat.

Taste - Like the nose, the profile was chocolate forward with cans of cinnamon. The booze was not terribly heavy. There was just a touch of spice that lingered at the finish.

Mouthfeel - I anticipated a bigger body with this beer. Did the barrel aging cause the body to deteriorate?

Overall - I had a little bit of disappointment with this one. It did not burn like regular bomb."
Barrel Aged Bomb!,4.62,"2021 vint 12 oz bottle into an oversized cognac snifter.
Pitch black. Low foam, leaves a lil ring of oily film instead.

S: Ripe raspberries, stone fruit jam, and a hint of port on the nose
T: Jammy profile rich with blackberries, raspberries, cherries, plums, and a slight whisper of apricots. The barrel aging supports with a gentle warmth and tannic vanilla. Mild funk on the finish that ends with a crisp tartness
F: Medium-bodied and well carbed
O: Stellar wild ale that’s full of jammy fruits and an interesting blend of barrels to support. Glad they brought back this one"
Orviamo,4.48,"Appearance - The beer was a deep, maroon color with visible carbonation.

Smell - Sour fruits are present, but do not overwhelm and burn the nose hairs. There was a sense of balance.

Taste - Having not read the bottle (because the print was really small), I thought I tasted cherries rather than raspberries. For this reason, I initially detected a strong cherry presence. Later, I corrected course to realize it was raspberry. The profile is reinforced by rich red wine. This one had some serious lingering power.

Mouthfeel - The profile lingered, seemingly coating the tongue in raspberry seeds.

Overall - I think this is a good spot to mention at the bottle was really hard to open."
Orviamo,5.0,"One of the finest beers I have ever had. Awesome taste, great funk. Pours so great and fluffy. Nice look and a perfect classic side project beer. Hopefully it's made many more times."

Mouthfeel - The carbonation was aggressive leading to some dry notes.

Overall - This was quite nice, but more sour than anticipated."
Blanc De Blancs,4.7,"Batch #2

Clear golden colour with no head

The smell is mouthwatering with a nice tartness, some fruity funky notes but quite clean, some wood, some vinous notes


The taste follows with a very sour profile, white stone fruits from the chardonnay, the oak is present but compliments well the whole thing. Quite balanced.
It gets better as it warms UP

The mouthfeel is dry but not astringent, fine natural carbonation

Overall it's a pleasure to drink such a nice brew which was waiting in my basement for some years now.
Not in style if we speak of bière de champagne but a wonderful wild ale with grape"
Blanc De Blancs,4.25,Tasted from bottle. Pours a hazy yellow with slight white head that quickly fades. Lots of wine grape notes with some apples and a little pear. Tart and sour but overly so. Excellent sipper. Well done.

Blanc De Blancs,3.98,"Very clear, light gold body; lively carbonation; no head. Nice farmhouse smells; barnyard funk, fresh cut hay, some lemon and other citrus notes. Very pleasant flavors; sweet white wine; green apple, lemon, raspberry, and peach; tart. Moderately heavy body; smooth and rather flat; very acidic overall with a touch of underlying sweetness for depth.

I heard good things about this beer and paid a pretty price for it ($65, actually ordered it by mistake, but so it goes). Overall, this is a decent beer for the style but not something I think warrants the price paid for it.

A huge shoutout to merpunk1 for hooking me up with this one in a trade! It’s the highest rated Bière de Champagne (and #245 overall), so it’s only fitting to drink this baby on New Years Eve. The rest of the day/night will consist of old classics, but it’s nice to open something fancy for my last review of 2021. Let’s get into it

Pours a cloudy orange gold with a finger of white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing. Eventually fades to absolutely nothing but it's still a decent looking beer

Man, I'm really digging the nose on this one, funky and delicate at the same time. I'm picking up on aromas of white grape, white wine vinegar, tangerine, sharp oak, and earthy apple

It's straight up explosive in taste, in your face and complex while being downright drinkable. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting tart green apple, sour white grape, wet hay, sharp oak, lemon zest, and crackery malt. The swallow brings notes of earthy white white, old leather, tart white grape, apple skin, sharp oak, floral honey, and lemon zest

A light medium body pairs with fine carbonation, resulting in a tart and crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry with just a touch of residual sweetness

This is great stuff, and a great kickoff to NYE. It's been a hell of a 2021, both on here and in my life and general. So, cheers BA, happy new year!"
Blanc De Blancs,4.3,"A 375ml bottle, blend #2, poured into a 3 Fonteinen stemmed glass.

Appearance: A clear golden colour with a half finger white head that dissipated fairly quickly to a ring around the glass while leaving only sparse lacing.

Aroma: Sweet, lightly tart, vinous, white grape, oak, honey, with light funky notes.

Taste: Sour, tart, vinous, white wine grapes, honey, oak, funk, with notes of sharp acidity but not overly so.

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate to soft carbonation.

Overall: Solid beer with nice aromas and flavours with abv completely hidden."
Aurelian Lure,4.45,"16.9oz bottle. For dating, label includes the details of 'BLEND SEVEN AUGUST 2022'.
Cloudy, apricot orange colored body. No real lasting head. No lacing.
Aroma of apricot, oak, and rich funk of expresses horse blanket, leather, and hay.
Taste is initially quite woody and herb bud like, and then the sweet/sour apricot comes in. Notes of lemon wash through, along with the dry oak. Late is white wine. The funk is very much of grass and hay. After taste does not last very long, but the essence of apricot lingers.
Tart and drying mouth feel. The teeth are scraped clean with each sip. Quiet carbonation.
The apricot expresses so naturally here, and is the longest lasting flavor note. The herb, oak, funk, and lemon are worthy subordinates."
Aurelian Lure,4.22,"Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy light amber color with a bubbly collar that fades away; no lacing

Smell: Bracingly sour; funky with an apricot tone

Taste: A hint of apricot passes across the tongue and is followed by a strong funky character; the apricot tone lingers underneath though, after the swallow, a bracing sourness emerges; oaky, dry and a lot of pucker in the finish

Mouthfeel: Light to medium body; no carbonation

Overall: Not for the uninitiated, Aurelian Lure harkens back to some of the tongue buckling sours that largely seem to have gone out of fashion these days"
Aurelian Lure,4.26,"Brewed with apricots, spontaneously fermented and allowed to ripen to full sour ale maturity, you'd think that this time honored way of beer making is rooted in the belly of Brussels. But nope, it's Austin Texas.

Aurelian Lure is the lambic-like brainchild of Jester King, pouring with a pale and deep lemon yellow with a light golden center. As the yeasty ale rises with a dainty champagne froth, the jaw-tightening scent of citrus, vinous and stone fruit carry the piquant tang of cider, dusty funk and extended oak aged white wine. As a scantly sweet taste briefly visit the tongue, early impressions of wafers, honey and sourdough offer a slim malt impact.

A quick wash of acidity across the middle palate shows a quick erase of anything malty and an ushering in of sour apricot that stand proud above the other fruity complements of weathered lemon, grapefruit, lime and yuzu. Dried pineapple, peach and white grape all continue to grow from the natural fermentae of the sour ale and play into a strikingly sour late palate of off-vinegar, mature and peppery acids that pang away on the sides of the tongue.

Light, crisp, succinct and highly refreshing, the session is sweat inducing and tooth achingly sour to satisfy the taste for unblended lambic in the deep south. As an afterglow of weathered woods, wine rot and an overall mossy type of earthiness come in brief waves, the aftertaste is otherwise short and concisely winey."
Aurelian Lure,3.94,"Murky darker yellow body with a white cap. Smell blasts you with sour apricot backed by complex oak, orange and farmhouse yeast. Taste is a cover up of the scandal. The scandal you ask? The apricot is wickedly acidic and pretty sour too, this is then covered up by farmhouse yeast, light barrel funk, lemon, and oak, but for that moment when the scandal was alone on the palate it was rough. Very bright and sour, funk is not impactful here, oak is brightly so, acidity builds as the secret wants to get out. I love JK but this is the #15 wild ale in the world? Nah, I wouldn't have this again"
Aurelian Lure,4.46,"Pours a hazy golden color with a thin head that dissipates immediately. The aroma is immediately noticeable, with a strong scent of apricots and a subtle hint of oak. Upon tasting, the apricot flavor dominates, with a tartness that is balanced by a slight sweetness. The oak barrel aging adds a layer of complexity, imparting a mild vanilla flavor that complements the fruitiness of the apricots. The beer finishes with a refreshing tartness that lingers on the tongue, leaving a dry finish.
One of the standout features of Aurelian Lure is its balance. Despite being a sour ale, the tartness is not overwhelming, and is instead complemented by the sweetness of the apricots and the subtle oak notes. This makes for a beer that is both complex and approachable, with a flavor profile that is likely to appeal to both seasoned sour beer enthusiasts and those new to the style.
Another noteworthy aspect of Aurelian Lure is its mouthfeel. The beer is medium-bodied with a light carbonation, which adds to the refreshing quality of the beer. The combination of tartness and effervescence make this a perfect summer beer, though it's enjoyable year-round.
Overall, Jester King Brewery's Aurelian Lure is a fantastic sour ale that showcases the brewery's expertise in wild yeast and spontaneous fermentation. It's a beer that is both complex and approachable, with a balanced flavor profile and a refreshing mouthfeel. While it may be difficult to find due to its limited availability, it's certainly worth seeking out for any beer enthusiast looking to try something truly special."
Aurelian Lure,4.13,Bold sour with apricots. Wood mixed fermentation. Very good sipper.
Juicy,4.81,"Appearance - The beer was golden orange in color with visible carbonation and a fluffy white head.

Smell - The nose was citrus forward. It brought to mind fresh grapefruit and lemon.

Taste - The citrus notes were intense, perfectly matching the farmhouse funk. It had a big lemon presence, with grapefruit, and fresh green apple. The funk really worked overtime. The profile dried up toward the finish.


Mouthfeel - The body had some viscosity, which allowed the lemon notes to linger until dry.

Overall - This beer was hype-worthy."
Juicy,4.27,"Look - Bright orange slight haze with a milky white head and sticky
Smell and taste - Citrus fruit and slightly tart
Feel - medium body and carb and dry
OVerall - pretty tasty"
Juicy,4.64,"Hefty 3-4 finger beige head
Vibrant Copper haze

Fumey Citrus calcite covered gummy Orange peel candy in the nose.

Medium body with lively carbonation. Tingles the tbuds from front to back wild lingering acidity and faint dull hops

Starts sweet muddled sugar and ramps up from orange to lemon to grapefruit. Hops are there then they mineralize. Dope!"
Juicy,4.41,"L -- Surprisingly amber-brown body with two fingers of white head produced with moderate pour. Some retention and good lacing.
S -- Definitely dry hopped! Some nice tropical notes along with a somewhat unpleasant medicinal note, almost like Pepto bismol. Also getting oak, mixed berry, and subtle barnyard funk. I like it more as it warms
T -- The name is pretty spot on here: this is surprisingly candy-like. Not overly tart, but there is some distinct lemon peel character. Great balance between hoppy and funky.
F -- Crisp, effervescent, eminently drinkable
O -- Definitely my favorite of the dry-hopped HF saisons

89/100"
Juicy,4.47,"Bottled on February 14, 2020. Pours a vibrant golden color with a finger of medium density white head that receded to a thin ring. Aroma is excellent. A combination of wine barrels, orange, lemon and miscellaneous tropical fruits burst from the glass. Maybe a little bit of tart funk, but it definitely takes a back seat.

On the tongue, the funk is much more present. The taste leads with wine barrel / oak funk. Mid palate I get some tropical notes, along with wildflowers. I don't believe any dandelions are in this beer, but to me it tastes like they are. On the very long finish, the funk has more of an earthy feel. Surprisingly full body. Well carbonated and smooth, despite a bit of acidity.

Overall, this is an excellent beer. Complex and layered in a way I don't often see. The barrels really add to the experience. An excellent example of what happens when skill and patience combine."
Darkstar November,4.47,"Forget about the adjuncts, this is Bottle Logic at its strongest -- a wonderful blending of complex bourbon barrel character, fudge, vanilla, and lightly spicy flavors, thick velvety mouthfeel, and not too much sweetness.

90/100"
Darkstar November,4.6,"Pours jet black. Aroma is sweet with a well balance of molasses, bourbon and dark chocolate. Taste is quite complex with tons of flavor. Dominate flavor is molasses with significant presence of spicy rye, dark chocolate, brown sugar, vanilla and some dark fruitiness. Full bodied as you'd expect. Incredible RIS."
Darkstar November,4.28,"2023 vintage

This is one of those awkward beers that floats in and out of the BA top 250 but I picked up for the tick anyways. Bottle Logic Stouts have been impressing me recently as well so I figured this one was worth a shot. Let’s pop it open and find out if it’s any good

Pours completely pitch black with 2 fingers of dreamy dark tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

The molasses is very forward in the nose, odd since I was expecting the rye to dominate but I can’t complain. I’m picking up on aromas of blackstrap molasses, chocolate fudge, sweet whiskey, vanilla bean, rye bread, earthy cinnamon, light raisin, and a touch of tonka bean

It’s more balanced in taste but the molasses is still super loud. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting toasted oak, sweet whiskey, rye spice, molasses, brown sugar, cocoa powder, vanilla bean, and light rasin. The swallow brings notes of blackstrap molasses, brown sugar, rye bread, maple syrup, vanilla bean, cocoa powder, tobacco, sweet whiskey, and raisin

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes mostly dry and drinks significantly below its abv

This is yet another great one from Bottle Logic. I’m not sure if it’s top 250 material, but still damn good"
Darkstar November,5.0,12/24/23 bottle @ home
Darkstar November,4.49,"A - Pour jet black with a thin tan head. Light soapy lacing.

S - Aroma is dark chocolate, molasses and borubon.

T - The taste is dark chocolate, molasses, vanilla, spicy rye and some light bourbon heat.

M - Full body with medium carbonation. Soft syrupy mouthfeel with a slick drying finish.

O - Top notch BA stout."
Darkstar November,4.45,"500 ml bottle into a snifter. 2022 edition, had 1/14/23.

Pours near black and opaque, with no head and a little oily cling. Aromas of bourbon, rye, chocolate, vanilla, roasted malt. Has a bit of a sweet and spicy aroma. Mostly the same flavors: bourbon, rye, chocolate, malt, vanilla, some molasses. Has a fairly spicy taste and a light sweet note. Smooth, a little creamy, a solid full body, appropriately carbonated.

Strong barrels and lots of rye is a pretty good recipe. It’s a little sweeter than expected, but this is pretty delicious.

Bottom of label stamped “2021” and “Batch *008*”. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Served at 61.2 degrees F (Recommended on label 58 degrees F) in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 66.3 degrees F.
Appearance – 4.5
First pour – Ruby Brown (SRM 24), slight light penetration.
Body – Ruby Brown (SRM 24), opaque. Under direct light, opaque. When rear lite, opaque except for light penetrating at the edges, ruby.
Head: Average (Maximum 1.8 cm, aggressive center pour), bronze, high density, quickly diminishing to a 0.15 – 0.35 cm undulating crown with no cap.
Lacing – None.
Aroma – 4.5 – Bourbon and rye whiskies, moderate chocolate, and some roasted malt. No yeast, no hops. No ethanol (14 % ABV according to the label).
Flavor – 4.5 – Chocolate and bourbon, some rye spiciness, light molasses sweetness and non-oppressive molasses flavor. No yeast, no hops. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. No ethanol flavor – well-hidden until an unscheduled belch. Pleasant gastric warming.
Palate – 4.5 – Full; distinctly creamy; soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.5 Damn, this is good! I’m a freak for rye bread, IPAs, stouts, whiskeys. I don’t think I’ve ever had an average beer from Bottle Logic – they are superb!"
Darkstar November,4.35,"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a dark brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of nice bourbon notes with some vanilla and woody notes, nice black chocolate malt notes with some rye notes also perceptible. Taste is also dominated by bourbon and vanilla notes with some rich black chocolate notes with some rye barrel notes also perceptible. Body is full with a nice creamy texture and good carbonation with no apparent alcohol. Well executed barrel-aged stout with some good drinkability."
Foggy Window,4.68,"After all these years, STILL underrated!"
Foggy Window,4.49,"16oz. can into a Becher glass. Creamy OJ looking IPA with a solid white head. The citra hops really shine on this with a nose full of citrus fruit, namely orange and slight grapefruit. Slightly resiny with a dry finish, which is exactly how I like my IPAs.
Super drinkable and dangerous for 8+%. Very well done IPA - well above the line."
Foggy Window,4.34,"From a 16oz can, dated 08/29/23. Served in a spiegelau IPA glass. Cap-tip to @franktank18 for his resourcefulness, incidental generosity, and just how murderous he looks in a tie.

Pours an opaque milky orange with two fingers of airy, whipped egg white-like foam. Retention is fairly decent, leaving a fizzy cap and sudsy, slippery lacing.

Nose is pretty faint but, what there is of it, seems to me sugary, candy-like. Aroma of lemon drops and orange LifeSavers.

Taste is less sweet than expected, drier and more tart. Tasting lemon rind, tangerine and gooseberries. Some astringency standing in for actual legitimate bitterness - but not such that I’d care to complain about it.

Feel is dry and drying, clean and maybe feeling a bit lighter bodied than it really is due to fairly aggressive bright and fizzy carbonation. There’s a mildly acidic and boozy smoulder in the gullet, not unexpected given the abv.

Overall, tasty and gone all too soon. In accordance with can instructions I shall now refrain from operating machinery for some appropriate period of time."
Foggy Window,4.48,"Appearance - The beer was the expected hazy orange color with a fluffy white head topping in the glass.

Smell - The moment I open the can , it radiated oranges. The sweetness was penetrating.

Taste - from the moment of the first sip, the profile was very orange forward. However, it was not all candy fruit, as there was a nice level of bitterness. There were notes of fluffy dreamsicle orange throughout the taste.

Mouthfeel - This was a thick one, with the haze clogging the spaces in between teeth.

Overall - This was a benchmark New England IPA."
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,4.25,"On tap at the brewery's gastropub in Athens, Ohio.

This is, I believe, one of the sweetest American Imperial Stouts I've ever had. Perhaps too sweet for my taste, and understandably boozy. Nonetheless, it's still excellent and has considerable complexity."
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,4.37,"Picked up a 2022 bottle from the brewery on 5-24-23 for $11.99. Consumed 7-6-24.

Beer poured black with little to no head.

Nose is very nice with notes of cinnamon, vanilla, and bourbon.

Taste is a large mildly roasted malt base that takes on all the adjuncts very well with the most prominent being habanero and cinnamon. In the background is a touch of chocolate and bourbon. Finishes nicely balanced courtesy of the barrel.

Mouthfeel is medium to large bodied and very smooth.

Overall buyer beware: if you are adverse to spicy peppers then don't waste your money as the habanero is prominent but not overwhelming. Personally, i totally dig this style of stout!"
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,3.62,"Purchaed at the Athens, OH brewery in June 2023. Poured at 56°. Thin layer of rocky tan bubbles which vanished quickly, leaving no cap retention, ring nor lace; no legs; black with ruby edges. Spicy nose, followed by chocolate and a bit of bourbon; hot spicy/boozy (13.7%) retro nasal. Spicy hot green chilies sauce entry; black pepper; chocolate (Oreo cookies come to mind); bourbon; cinnamon as beer warms; minimal vanilla; no walnuts from the the base beer. Hot mouth warmth from habaneros, spices and alcohol; thin watery body; light carbonation. Overall, unbalanced; my mouth is on fire; it’s so hot the beer burns all the way down my gullet; not enjoyable; I like spicy Mexican cake style stouts, but this beer is extreme; glad I only bought one."
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,3.88,"2023-07-03
375ml bottle served in a little snulip. Vintage 2022. Got it from @ozzylizard in NBS BIF #17.

Pours black with no head, looks still. Smell is bourbon and vanilla, burnt toffee and near-burnt nuts, sweet molasses, hint of something like cinnamon or nutmeg.

Taste is (for me) dominated by cinnamon. Nuts are still there, and something comes across as milk chocolate. Molasses sweetness. I was feeling a little bit of spice on my lips and thinking it was a bit odd for cinnamon to have that much power but not be totally overwhelming for me, and then I read on the label that it contains habaneros, and that's clearly evident now that I saw it. As it's warming up, the cinnamon is becoming even more powerful.

Mouthfeel is nicely thick and chewy. Overall...it appears to be a pretty good stout with a nice level of pepper, but too much cinnamon for me."
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,5.0,I fell in love with this beer from the beauty on the label to the deep dark color to smooth finish. I used to drive all the way to Danvers to purchase it at Total Wine. Then Covid hit. Are you going to brew up a new batch? I would buy an extra large Tee shirt of the lovely lady and walk around as free advertising too.
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,4.3,"Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro from Jackie O’s, 12.7 oz bottle. Received from brewery 05/04/23. Reviewed 10/04/23 (Review 3070). Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Printed on the label “2022”. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Served at 54.6 degrees F in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 59.0 degrees F.
Appearance – 3.75.
First pour – Ruby Brown (SRM 24), almost opaque.
Body – Deep Brown (SRM 30), opaque. Under direct light, same. When rear lite, shows a translucent olive at the top edge and ruby at the bottom.
Head – None. While pouring, a five mm crescent of large bubbles appears on about a third of the circumference but quickly evaporates.
Lacing – None.
Aroma – 4.25 – Bourbon and barrel are the predominant aromas, no malt, no yeast, no hops, no chocolate. Oddly, no habaneros. No ethanol (13.7 % ABV as marked on the label) aroma.
Flavor – 4.5 – The habaneros set up a nice oral burn, not too hot and lacking any vegetal flavor. Cinnamon rides in on the aftertaste. Initially no hops, malt, or yeast; light chocolate and ghostly vanilla. Slight gastric warming, but that could be from capsaicin as well as ethanol. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.
Palate – 4 – Medium; creamy; soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.25 Lacking both head and lacing, the appearance loses a few points. Both the flavor and aroma are quite good, with distinct hits of habaneros, cinnamon, cocoa, and even detectable vanilla, all supported by the bourbon and barrel. Very good and well worth grabbing if you run across a bottle or six. Extra points for having a lizard on the label."
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,4.4,"Poured from a 12.7 ounce bottle, the body is a dark cola brown. Small initial head that quickly dissipated and no lacing of consequence.

Aroma is a complex mix of bourbon, cinnamon, vanilla, and chile. The habanero aroma is muted but present.

Taste follows nose though the barrel is a tad sweeter than the nose. You'll need to be patient to pick up the notes of walnut and oak rising from the stout upon which this beer was made (Oil of Aphrodite). The habanero is felt in the swallow, but it's a light heat. In fairness, I love habs and you might perceive more heat. The cinnamon and cacao nibs balance the pepper and the barrel holds everything together in an unlikely tasty stout. A bit more malty char would be welcome, but that's a personal preference and not a complaint.

Mouthfeel is good but not great. I'd love a bit more body in this stout. More carbonation would be welcome.

Overall an outstanding stout that I interestingly found a bit better when colder than I usually drink stouts. The mix seemed more flavorful when first poured."
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,3.99,"B11 (2020). Appearance is a bright translucent yellow with plenty of persistent white head. Aroma, while somewhat muted, is really nice up close. Blind, I might actually think this was a hefeweizen given the clove like esters I'm getting.

Taste is more in line with what I was expecting, with lemon & hay and some mixed fruit. Very light and tasty and extraordinarily easy drinking. Absolutely perfect way to end a beautiful long weekend."
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.3,"Appearance: Faintly cloudy straw-yellow with a slight cap of bubbles on the top that quickly subsided.

Smell: Moderate barnyard funk, grassy/hay notes, and mild fruity notes.

Taste: Following the hints from the nose, I pick up moderate funk notes, moderate grassy/hay notes, and mild citrus fruit notes. The individual flavors are very distinct from each other but at the same time form a cohesive flavor profile. The beer finishes dry with some mildly bitter grassy/hay notes.

Mouth-feel: Light-bodied with a modest level of carbonation.

Overall: A very nice Saison. Tasty flavor profile with a light body and dry finish."
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.31,"Cloudy golden body with a white cap that settles into a collar. Grapefruit, lemon, bright oak, faint melon and passion fruit, faint yeast nose. Taste is simpler with big lemon and oak, mild saison yeast, faint ripe tropical fruits. Feel is light and cool, sour and slightly acidic, dries a bit with yeast on finish"
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.23,Bottle: Poured a blonde color ale with a large white foamy head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of tart notes with some funky Brett notes and light vinous notes. Taste is a mix of tart notes with some funky Brett notes and a vinous finish with light oak. Body is about average for style with good carbonation and no perceptible alcohol. Enjoyable saison with a nice level of complexity.
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.51,"Pours soft hazy yellow/straw with a massive head and great retention. Nose is primarily brett, lemon, oak, but smells fantastic. Taste is similar to the nose a light tartness from the lemon and hay, funk from the brett, and balance from the oak. The flavors all blend together wonderfully to form a fantastic saison. The mouthfeel is soft and pillowy. Each taste of the slight tartness invites additional sipping. Just a wonderful farmhouse ale."
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.32,"Poured from a 750mL bottle into my Troubadour tulip:

Lightly hazy icterine liquid supports a half finger of magnolia soft peaks. Crenelated, nearly rocky lacing; superior retention.

Lemon curd, wildflowers, hay, and short bread in the nose - mild wild notes and hints of white grapes as well.

Brett. forward on the palate, tart, funky, and gently peppery. Unripe pears, meyer lemon, and some minerality. Low bitterness, moderate sourness. More fruit than phenols. Finishes fairly dry with some residual ""wild"" elements. Flavor improves a bit as it warms with some faint peach emerging.

Medium bodied, soft, well carbonated. Refreshing yet satisfying.

Well crafted; controlled rather than rustic. Better with food, as the ale's flavors seem more refined and diverse in contrast to whatever bread/cheese you might pair them with."
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.65,"On tap at Windsor Homebrew in Anaheim, CA.

Tally ho! I feel like Errol Flynn in “The Seahawk” while drinking this thing. Just wow. It’s as if nothing can stop me and that I could have it all. Maybe my mind is even a bit blurred and stirred by its beauty. So much so that I think that I don’t need Olivia de Haviland because I want them all.

I am lost. I am found. I am. I just am."
Abt 12,4.22,"Aged for 15 years! The maximum recommended by the brewer, so it was time. Poured from a 750ml bottle into a goblet. Probably somewhere in the vicinity of 60 F.

A: Reddish amber goldenrod ombré in the glass, frothy persistent off-white head with heterogenous bubbles and slight lacing. 4

S: Yeasty and malty, with a raisin and plum character. Brings a little savory and herbal character along for the ride, almost reminiscent of marinara sauce. Some clove and medicinal herbs. Strong alcohol. 4

T: Heavy malt, with a rich savory character. Not a whole lot of nuance left. Raisin, stone fruit. Treacle and brown sugar. Very similar in character to aged ruby port. 4

M: Alcohol is very muted when cold, but then moves to the forefront. Smooth and pleasant in its texture. 4

Overall: The beer itself was nice, and I enjoyed it for what it was, but it was almost beside the point. This was the culmination of an “investment” I made before I had even reached my third decade, almost half a lifetime ago. An illicitly bought gift from my 19-year-old self who had no idea where or when this bottle would be enjoyed. It turned out this was to be in 2024, in my hometown where I had moved back to, enjoyed with a good friend, on an unseasonably warm (84 F) autumnal equinox. This bottle “watched” from the cellar as I graduated from college, lived in multiple countries on multiple continents, lost loved ones, got married, and bought a house. A great portion of a great life; perhaps the true beauty of the beer was this chance to reflect.

It’s honestly hard to say what effect storing it for 15 years had, as I have never had the beer before and didn’t have a fresh version to compare with, but given how other beers have aged over even a year or two, this was a stellar beer that I have to give credit to for being well crafted. For this, it gets a 5 overall."
Abt 12,4.39,"Bought from Oxford Tesco, 23 Aug 2024. Gorgeous stuff, one of my favourite beers along with Rochefort 10. I prefer the latter, partly because it’s got the Trappist mystique placebo effect in my head, but I also feel the Bernardus has a slightly acrid after taste. I do however habitually drink it at a higher temperature than recommended, so that could be my fault. Still, pretty much the best beer that can be bought in a UK supermarket."
Abt 12,4.95,"I drank this ale when it was called St. Sixtus. That's how long I have been on my beer quest. I wonder how many of you even know that it was once called St. Sixtus? I don't know when the name was changed, but I first had this in the nineteen fukin eighties. That's right, the 1980s. It's a wonderful ale! Is it really Westy in a different bottle? Who knows? Who cares? They taste around the same to me. I never did a head to head comparison though. However the fact that it is easily obtained and relatively cheap make it better than Westy for me."
Abt 12,5.0,"Words only go so far with a beer like this. Pours an absolutely perfect head that stays fully through drinking. The aroma, mouthfeel, adjunts, and overall experience need to be tasted to be believed. Malt, banana, chocolate, coffee. The complexity of this beer is an endless endeavor. This is the beer that got me INTO beer. It's absolutely perfect. A totally unique, undefeated experience. Keep your eyes peeled for the winking monk!"
Abt 12,4.19,"St Bernardus Abt 12

Cellared for two years. 11.2 ounce bottle poured into a vintage St. Bernardus chalice. Charming, simple label on the bottle in bright blue. Almost reminds me of a children's book.

L: Solid, chocolate brown. Smooth foam that slides down the glass when swirled.

A: Candied, boozy sweetness, like a rum-soaked fruitcake.

T: Initial taste is indeed fruity; plum, apricot, and a hint of dark rum. Then comes the bubblegum, followed by orange rind in a mildly bitter finish. Alcohol is nigh undetectable, except for the rum notes. Pleasant aftertaste, only slightly cloying.

F: Smooth and creamy. Root beer.

O: A delicious beer. You really can't go wrong with Trappist ales. I'm in the minority as I prefer their Tripel, but this is a close second when comparing the two. You'll be happy either way."
Abt 12,4.39,I love quads and this is no exception. Will def get this again. Good abv and the flavor mixes in well
The Abyss,4.23,"2021 vintage poured into a 16oz tulip, fairly aggressive pour. Gorgeous tumbling not unlike the pour of a Guinness with an initial large mocha shaded head. Very intricate flavors of black licorice, dark chocolate, dark fruit, bourbon of course, and burnt coffee intermingle extremely well. A bit too much char for my liking, but I can't fault the craftmanship here. Density is perfect, not too thin or viscous. Stands up to its rating IMO"
The Abyss,4.51,"First time trying this classic which has recently become available in my state.

From bottle marked packed on 11/20/23.

Poured into my tulip glass this stout is used motor oil black with a tight mocha cap. Head recedes to an oily skim with some bubbles around the edges leaving plenty of soapy lace.

Scent is boozy bourbon vanilla. Chocolate cherries? Roasty coffee notes.

Taste is rich with dark chocolate and fudge notes, vanilla, chocolate cherries. Bourbon although not as pronounced as in the nose. Raisins, figs, dark fruit. There's something which I couldn't quite discern but that I realize now is licorice. There's a subtle bitterness and some spicy hop notes which seem to build as I sip. Nice long finish delivering waves of chocolate, fudge, vanilla but ending with a dry crisp bitterness which keeps the beer from being overly sweet.

Mouth is velvety and voluptuous.

When a beer of this ABV is so quickly and easily emptied that I wonder where it went and wish I had another I consider it a testament to the brewers skills."
The Abyss,4.25,"Purchased at Bound Berverage, Warrington, PA. $20.50/4pk 12oz bottles. Purchased in March 2024 and bottle has a packaged on date of 4/28/21, so this appears to have almost 3 years of aging.

Pours a very viscous, deep, dark abyss black. A thin, tight bubble, dark tan colored head on the initial pour.

Aromas of chocolate and a slight boozy smell.

A delicous stout. Numerous flavors hit you right away of bitter dark chocolate, coffee, deep roasted malts and a boozy bourban flavor. A bitter and tangy aftertaste. The ABV is noticeable but doesn’t overpower the flavor profile.

Thick, creamy consistency with mild carbonation.

A top-notch stout. However, I’m not sure it deserves a 99/100 rating. Just a bit too dry and bitter on the aftertaste for my liking. That being said, I’d still recommend it…cheers!"
The Abyss,4.3,"Tonight’s Cellaruary pull is also a side by side. I’ve had the 2014 vintage for almost a year and forgot about it until I recently got the 2022 vintage from Tavour. That made me remember the 2014 and made me realize Cellaruary is the perfect time for this vertical tasting (which will leave me destroyed for the night after drinking all of this). I’ve never had any vintage of this beer before, but it should be interesting to see the difference 8 years makes in this beer.

2014: Pours completely pitch black with a finger of soapy light tan head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves decent lacing
2022: The exact same as the 2014, but leaves just a bit less lacing behind

2014: There’s a bit of a funk in the nose here, but I’m not complaining. I’m picking up on aromas of molasses, tannic red wine, cherry pit, cocoa powder, medium roast coffee, aged hops, sharp oak, smoky tobacco, and leather
2022: This one is way more hoppy and bitter as expected, but I can see how the aromas here can evolve into the funkier aromas in the older beer. I’m picking up on aromas of leafy hops, molasses, cacao nib, medium roast coffee, burnt sugar, orange marmalade, toasted oak, smoky tobacco, vanilla bean, and light caramel

2014: There’s less to it in taste unfortunately, but I still dig it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting molasses, burnt sugar, smooth oak, vanilla bean, licorice, smoky tobacco, cocoa powder, raisin, and light coffee. The swallow brings notes of cherry pit, molasses, aged hops, smoky tobacco, cacao nib, leather, raisin, and medium roast coffee
2022: Similarly here it just tastes like a watered down version of what the nose had promised, but again, still good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting leafy hops, burnt sugar, golden raisin, caramel, toasted oak, vanilla bean, light roast coffee, and cacao nib. The swallow brings notes of leafy hops, cacao nib, vanilla bean, cherry pit, burnt sugar, smoky tobacco, medium roast coffee, chicory, and light caramel

2014: A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick and chewy beer. Finishes a tad sticky but dries out over time
2022: A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes mostly dry and quite bitter

It’s amazing how different these beers are yet are scored nearly the same. They’re both damn good in their own ways. My official review will use the scores of the fresher bottle

2014:
4.29/5   -4%

The Abyss,5.0,"De beerrepublic.eu. En copa Teku. Con pistachos. Viendo Luke Cage 1x07. La.verdad es que el paso por barrica no se nota nada, pero lo que si hay es un delicioso perfil lupulado rollo black IPA que resulta sorprendentemente ligero y refrescante para tan elevado abv"
The Abyss,2.8,"Very dark, nearly black. Brown head sticks around. Smell of Hershey's chocolate syrup. Taste does have some spice but primarily molasses and ethanol. Sweet. Negligible bitterness. Feel is dominated by ethanol burn. Not as viscous as I would have guessed. Fine for a porter or stout. But pretty heavy and dark."
The Abyss,4.68,"I don’t usually drink stouts, but love to occasionally try them. I will buy this when ever I find it. Easily the best beer I’ve ever had."
The Abyss,3.95,"April 2021 12oz bottle from a Chimay chalice

L- deep dark color, no light from my iPhone gets through this beer at all. Very little to no head.
S- dark sweet chocolate
T- sweet milk chocolate sone hoppiness and a bit dry to the finish. The ABV is undetectable and this drinks way too easy for what it is. My biggest issue is there is ZERO barrel here, Zero!
F- quite thin for what this beer brings with it. Has a silky feel, just needs more body. There is no carbonation.

O- this was a beer I always wanted. Would not put out the $ for the bombers. Found these 4 packs in 2021 and overall am disappointed. Not a bad beer but with Zero barrel and a light body I’m out after I finish the one more I have sitting."
The Abyss,3.64,"L - Look is black like coffee bu with little head
S- Smell isn't potent, smoky stout.
T - The taste is of course the stand out. Very complex. very bitter and earthy. Possibly the most earthy stout I've ever had. I personally enjoy more sweet stouts where this is very very bitter and woody. However, I believe the complexity and richness speaks to the craft and would be absolutely loved by some.
F - Feel is slightly bubbly and thick.
O - As stated, I want to like it but it's not quite sweet enough for my tastes, and it's extreme earthiness is beyond my pallet. That said it's enjoyable and worth a try."
The Abyss,4.96,"Aged leather gives way to notes of strong, dark licorice. There are notes of burnt marshmallow in there, as well as a taste of either ripe plums or fresh Mediterranean figs. With an ABV of over 11%, this beer does not come off as overly boozy, despite its aging in bourbon and French oak barrels. Finally, there is a finish of sarsaparilla and milky molasses.

This beer will only get better with age. I see this beer as mellowing its edges with another year or two (if you can wait that long), on the shelf, aging."
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,4.54,"From a 16oz can dated Autumn 2023 into a tulip.

Pours an opaque pitch black with a bout four fingers of tight brown head. Incredible retention, great lacing.

Strong smells of nuts, coffee and baker's chocolate.

Taste follows. Strong black coffee and bitter dark chocolate up front with milk chocolate and nuts in the background.

Full-bodied mouthfeel. Bitter aftertaste. Not as smooth drinking as I was expecting. Nice small sips to extend the enjoyment. Probably all the coffee. Aftertaste is a mixture of bitter coffee and dark chocolate.

Obviously Tree House is known for their NEIPAs but don't sleep on their milk stouts! Great beer."
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,4.38,Pours a deep dark almost black color with a finger of tan head. The nose and flavor profile are dominated by notes of Hershey's Chocolate Syrup. The mouthfeel is lush and sticky.
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,4.9,"#153, well done!"
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,3.8,"Canned November, 2019. Pour is as dark as beer comes, with a small amount of short-lived head. Aroma is better than expected given the age. Plenty of cocoa and chocolate with some almost coffee like elements. Really nice smelling beer. Taste has also held up really well. Lots of smooth chocolate. Semi-sweet and well balanced with some nice roasted notes. Overall, pretty good beer. I'm impressed with how well this has held up."
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,4.23,"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Charlton, MA
2022
Served in a Tree House Brewing Company tulip

The beer poured a syrupy and rather intense looking pitch black hue. An inch-tall, tight and creamy, mocha colored crown topped the liquid and slowly fell to a thick, lasting collar. Streaks and drops of lacing stuck all along the sides of the glass.

The aroma was decent initially and definitely improved with time. Moderately roasty with day-old coffee notes. Bit of acrid character and perhaps some raw cocoa too. As the beer sat, sweet, creamy lactose notes appeared. Good dose of vanilla as well. Chocolate syrup was also noticeable. The sweetness and the chocolate character intensified as the beer sat.

The flavor profile was also solid but perhaps not as smooth as the nose. Malty and robust up front. Roasted malts were most apparent. Moderate caramel malt presence too. Cold coffee was also noticeable. Subtle lactose and vanilla notes were detectable in the center. Slightly sweet. More roastiness on the back end and the finish. Moderate amount of bitterness. Some alcohol warmth came through as well.

Nice creamy, smooth mouthfeel. Medium bodied for the style. Slightly syrupy. The liquid contained a finer beaded, somewhat prickly effervescent that turned fluffy on the palate.

All That Is And All That Ever Will Be is an enjoyable beer, though not as impressive as its ratings might suggest. Both the flavor profile and the mouthfeel came across as a bit flat. I feel like many of Tree House’s imperial milk stouts definitely suffered in quality when they moved from bottles into cans."
Abraxas,4.62,On tap at stl beer festival. Wow. Incredible.
Abraxas,4.62,"First pour from the bomber was a syrupy umber tar with a very thin head. I was worried this might taste like Boulevard's Maple Mood or Plaid Habit which have an overpowering alcohol forward taste with sweetness mixed in. Nope! You can do more than sip hesitantly on this. Taste is extremely malty with cinnamon and dark cocoa. Feel is thinly syrupy with a biting carbonation that threw me a little, although that may be the ""chiles"" talking. Would definitely recommend as a solid beer vs. many seasonal flavored stouts I've tried."
Abraxas,4.55,"750ml bottle from a US visit. Served cool into a long-stemmed trappist glass. Listed at 10.5% ABV. Been waiting a while to cross this one off my list.

Appearance - Slick and oily looking from the glass, pitch black with a finger plus of short lived deep tan head with a nice hiss. Leaves a tiny soapy collar and no lacing.

Smell - Cinnamon is the biggest star, with a healthy amount of dark chocolate and vanilla to back things up. Maybe it's the combo with the chilis, but the cinnamon really pops in the most pleasant of ways.

Taste - Sort of sweet with the chocolate leading up front, vanilla mixed in and plenty of cinnamon. Becomes more bitter with some darker chocolate, a touch of earthiness and the peppers start to kick in. Then afterwards the chilis continue to prickle which is enhanced by the cinnamon. Maybe even a hint of smoke in the aftertaste. A flavor profile that will stay with you for a while.

Mouthfeel - Full bodied and with low carbonation, but luscious and velvety with the prickliness from the peppers once and then again the peppers come for round two with the cinnamon riding shotgun.

Overall - I've enjoyed my fair share of the Mexican style Imperial Stouts in my time, but Abraxas, just seems to delve a little deeper than most of the competition (which are excellent stouts in their own rights), with the linger chilis and the prevalence but not overuse of cinnamon coming through in such a pronounced manner. Awesome beer that should be enjoyed at cellar (but not fridge) temperature and completely worth the arm and leg of financial cost needed to obtain it. For a special sipper, it's worth it."
Abraxas,5.0,"Taken from fridge and allowed to warm before pouring into a stemmed wine goblet. Pitch black, with a thin tan head. Untappd lists this at 80 IBU, but I'm not getting it. What I am getting are huge aromas and flavors of cocoa, cinnamon, and vanilla, plus char, licorice, chili heat, and enough alcohol warmth to ""...light up the city of Toledo"" ($1 to Trapper John McIntyre). It's also quite sweet, with a syrupy mouthfeel and a long and satisfying finish. Nothing to complain about here. This pushes all the right buttons for me."
Abraxas,4.73,"Pours jet black with a huge creamy tan head. The aroma is incredible. I get cinnamon up front with some of the chilis. I get a touch of chocolate but no vanilla. Holy crap is this balanced. The taste is cinnamon, chilis and chocolate. No bitterness, but not cloyingly sweet either. Alcohol is not noticeable. Hard to say I've had a better imperial stout. 10/10"
Abraxas,4.53,"Horse, super dark with a nice tan head. The nose is slightly cinnamon, and even more slightly char. The taste is soft with a bite of cinnamon. The ABV is not super evident as one would expect. Obviously a world-class beer."
Abraxas,4.7,"L - Deep brown, nearly pitch black with a small tan head that dissipates quickly leaving no real lacing
S - cinnamon and chillis straight away followed by rich chocolate, roasted malts, hints of vanilla
T - deep, complex flavors: rich bakers chocolate and cinnamon, quickly followed by rich roasted chillis, roasted malt, and hints of vanilla. Sometimes I feel like there is some berry fruit/cab sav flavor profiles coming though. Really interesting brew.
F - full bodied with light carbonation - smooth, silky
O - truly incredible stout. A Xocoveza on steroids."
Stickee Monkee,4.4,"L: Pours a muddy tootsie roll brown color with a very small white tan head and no lacing.

S: Notes of sweet brown sugar, chocolate, caramel and a nice sweetness. Hints of Belgian Candi sugar and a lighter, hints of vanilla and bourbon.

T: Belgian Candi sugar, brown sugar and caramel mixes with vanilla a light chocolate and a hint of bourbon and very little hop. Very enjoyable. The booze is very well hidden in this beer.

F: Big body smooth carbonation

O: As always Firestone hits it out of the park."
Stickee Monkee,3.54,"2017 Vintage

Pour is dark amber before settling into a deeper brown in the glass. Maybe half an inch of tan colored head that receded to a thin ring. Aroma is faint brown sugar and molasses, with no barrel to speak of.

Things pick up a little bit in the taste department. Still plenty of molasses & brown sugar, but unlike the nose, there is plenty of barrel coming through, which keeps this balanced. Plenty of alcohol, which results in nice alcohol warming.

Good beer"
Stickee Monkee,4.67,"2014 bottle.

Stickee Monkee is a Belgian-style ale brewed by Firestone Walker Brewing Co. This beer has received much recognition for its complex flavors and rich, dark appearance. It is a sipper, meant to be savored slowly and appreciated for its full range of flavors.

Appearance: Stickee Monkee has a deep, dark brown color with a hint of red. It has a fluffy, beige head that quickly dissipates. The beer is slightly cloudy with visible sediment, which is characteristic of a traditional Belgian-style ale.

Aroma: The aroma of Stickee Monkee is complex and full of depth. The beer has a strong aroma of dark fruit such as raisins, figs, and plums. It also has notes of caramel, toasted malt, and a hint of spicy, earthy hops.

Taste: The taste of Stickee Monkee is equally as complex as its aroma. It has a rich, malty sweetness with notes of dark fruit, caramel, and toasted malt. The beer also has a slight bitterness that balances out the sweetness and helps to round out the flavors. The finish is slightly spicy with a hint of alcohol warmth.

Mouthfeel: Stickee Monkee has a medium-to-full body with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. The beer is not too heavy, but it is substantial enough to make you feel satisfied after just one sip. It also has a slight alcohol warmth that adds to the overall experience.

Overall Impression: Stickee Monkee is an outstanding beer that is perfect for those who appreciate complex and flavorful beers. It has a great balance of sweetness, bitterness, and alcohol warmth that makes it a great choice for those who love a strong, dark beer.

Stickee Monkee,4.5,"2021 version poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter. After a short absence, I'm glad to see this beer back. It is still the fine sweet goodness I remember."
Stickee Monkee,4.49,"12oz bottle 2018 vintage that turned up in my LBS this week poured into a chalice at 47°F 11.4% ABV. The beer pours opaque medium brown with light brown head. The head recedes to a thin ring and little else. No lacing. The aroma is moderate in strength featuring candi sugar, raisin, bourbon and leather. The taste is semisweet caramel, bourbon and brown sugar with lingering tobacco, oak and leather on the finish. Minimal bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with just less that average carbonation and a semi dry finish. ABV is well hidden with just a touch of heat on the back end and no ethanol aroma or taste. Overall, excellent."
Stickee Monkee,4.16,"Rare 2015 vintage draught pour at Apex Bar in Portland OR.
Presented flat. No foam at all. Deep brown, borders on black.
Smells great. Dark stone fruits and that famiiar Quad on the nose.
Taste is toes on the line too sweet, but it doesn’t become cloying or teeth-achingly so. I think maybe because it’s 7 years old, some if the nuances intended have been lost. But the dark brown sugar, stewed plums and oak barrel all make appearances throughout the chew.
Feel is very dense, quite viscous, no carbonation.
Overall, good to get a draught hit, but 7 years of hiding has worn its beauty down."
Stickee Monkee,4.52,"2018 vintage, poured into a FW mini snifter.

Dark brown pour with minimal carbonation. Scents of candi sugar, caramel, and dried fruit. Sweet flavor of candy, and a warming finish. Certainly a fine example of the style, and one that aged well."
Stickee Monkee,4.44,"2021 Vintage consumed on 10-30-2022

A bit of smoke on the opening of the bottle. Dark brown pouring with a 2 finger tan head, with a fairly aggressive pour. The retention is decent, and there's some lacing on the glass.
The aroma is strong with dark fruit - I get a lot of plum and raisin in the nose.
Taste - Tons of plum and raisin hit up front. There's a hint of caramel and toffee on the back. I also get a creamy flavor mixing in, almost a lactose flavor. This last thing surprised me, probably not getting it right.
The body is very thick and full. Smooth, and very little alcohol burn.
I love this beer, and so glad I bought it."
Stickee Monkee,4.22,"The beer is mahogany, dark brown color. The beer fizz with sound while pouring, but leaves a thin layer of foam only, which disappears very quickly. The beer smells dark, smoky, brown sugar, coffee, leather, molasses and whiskey barrel oaky. The wooden, oaky barrel aroma is distinct, it’s clearly a barrel-aged strong ale.

The beer is full bodied, velvety, latte creamy, with a bit of fizz tickling on tongue. The beer is moderate sweet (it’s 2016 bottle? 6 years later it’s still not dry?), with a bold palate, with a bit sour (tart cherry), light bitter and subtle salty at back. The taste is great, renders the beer bold, but the flavor is on the stout side than a quad (which should be drier?) to me. The malty backbone is strong, and there’s dark sugar (Turbinado brown sugar from Mexico) added which is not that fruity but with molasses and toffee candy hints. When I sip, I sense some dark chocolate, roasted chestnut nutty, alcohol burn, salted toffee candy, leather and tobacco earthiness, whiskey filled chocolate bottle, dried fig and raisin aromas. The beer taste bold, very malty and dark sugar characters, but it’s not ester heavy nor fruity. My feeling of this beer is a serious gentleman who will not wink or smile, but just sitting still and sipping cigar. This is a malty beverage, really malty, I think it may need another 5 years of aging to became more mellow. I expect more layers in this beer, but currently it’s just a bit too sweet (malty) to enjoy."
Stickee Monkee,4.5,"2017 vintage... poured from a boxed bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip

L: Dark mahogany grown pour... cloudy and with 2 fingers of off-white head. Great retention/lacing.

S: Rich and malty. Brown sugars, molasses, spice, and grains.

T.F: Semi-sweet and rich. Loads of toffee, caramel, and molasses. Dark fruits... with fig and baked raisin. Baking spice and plum. Tobacco, leather, vanilla, and oak. Boozy and smooth. Medium bodied... warming.

O: An elite Belgian Quad from California. Held up superbly in the cellar and a pleasure to finally crack this one."
Samuel Adams Utopias,4.41,"Samuel Adams Utopias pours a dark, clean, amber color with no head. The aroma has sweet notes of raisins and dried fruit. The flavor is complete, with sweet raisins and dates and hints of bourbon, dry, port, and sherry-like flavors mixed in. It's flat, but it still works well for this beer. Overall, it is a very rich, complex beer with lots of fried fruit flavors."
Samuel Adams Utopias,4.55,"Deep copper color- no head, no lace.
aroma of alcohol, malts, hints of vanilla and caramel.
taste was sweet with alcohol warmth and smooth hints of barrel flavor.
Some vanilla, caramel and a buttery richness.
Complex and deep with no carbonation and full bodied heavy malts at play.
Over loads the senses yet easy to drink despite high ABV.
This goes well with sweets on a cold winter night.
Some spices in finish maybe nutmeg and a little syrup on the tongue."
Samuel Adams Utopias,4.49,"Sample pour from the 2017 vintage bottle.
Dark bourbon brown colored body. Still body. A sheen clings to the glass.
Aroma is very much like fermented turpentine. Some dark fruit and vanilla.
Taste is quick and then evaporates. Full of fruit, from apple to date to cherry. Caramel nugget and vanilla. Strong alcohol.
Thick mouth feel. Smooth. Even with the high ABV% there is no burn. No carbonation.
A little bit of a barleywine and a little bit of a port, with alcohol soaked sweetness. This is the second beer I have rated in 2024."
Samuel Adams Utopias,4.0,"My Utopias was bottled in 2007, number 05260. it was too much maple for me in 2007, but i had maybe 30 mL 12/26/2023 and it has improved a lot. i think i paid $250 USD for it. for as long as it has lasted, it's worth it.... it's making me enter a rating, so i gave it all 4's"
Samuel Adams Utopias,4.57,"Samuel Adams Utopias 2023 American Strong Ale, 28% ABV. The room temperature 4oz pour is very deep reddish brown, with no head since it's uncarbonated. It leaves an oily sheen on the glass. Aroma is clearly boozy, plus chocolate, red wine, and dark fruit, very unique and enjoyable. Wish I had that in a cologne. Taste is not as good as the aroma, chocolate, wine, and dark fruit, quite boozy, not much sweetness, slight bitterness, and tons of bourbon burn. Mouthfeel is excellent, overall outstanding. Very complex. The bottle cap surprised me, but makes sense."
Samuel Adams Utopias,3.99,"Poured from a 2019 Utopia bottle into a Glencarin glass.

L - Poured a murky brown Iced Tea color. No carbonation, head or lacing, as to be expected.

S - Alcohol is pretty powerful and in your face, but there is also big aroma of dark dried fruit, Think fig, raisins, dates. etc... Like a strong English Barleywine or a good German Dopplebock.

T- There is definitely some heat from the high ABV, but there is also that delicious dark dried fruit taste with dare I say a bit of cacao? Reminded me a bit of the Chunky candy bar.

MF - The mouthfeel is rather thin and a little oily. That being said, it coats the mouth well and the high AVB lets it linger for awhile.

Overall Utopia is a definite splurge. If you have a Beer Geek friend or 2 and can afford it, it's definitely worth checking out at least once in your life. Is it wildly overpriced, yes, is it mind blowing, no. That being said, after splitting a bottle with a great friend, I have zero regrets,"
Samuel Adams Utopias,4.82,"Poured at 64°. Murky brown pour but settles down to almost full clarity; no head, ring nor lace; heavy legs on swirl. Nose is Sherry, boozy caramel with a phenolic exhale. Entry is boozy hot Sherry like flavor; sugary raisins; sweet caramel malt. Viscous, almost chewy feel; medium plus body; hot mouthfeel from 28% abv; alcohol burn on tip of tongue; face flushing warmth. Overall a power house of a high abv strong ale; potent; looking forward to enjoying this beer many times!"
Samuel Adams Utopias,4.45,"2017 vintage - shared with me from a friend. Small 2oz pour for each of us. Served in a small 4oz snifter tasting glass.

Appearance: Clear dark amber-copper color. No lacing (there wouldn't be at this ABV).

Smell: Boozy - bourbon barrel notes, honey, toffee. Rich.

Taste: Lots going on. Definitely some barleywine notes, with some bourbon, oak, vanilla, toffee, honey, orange, raisin, and some bitter notes at the finish as well.

Mouthfeel: Surprisingly smooth for something this high in alcohol. Good thickness, no carbonation, dry finish, and only a little warming.

Overall / Drinkability: I can see why some people describe this a more like a brandy than a beer, and I almost want to call it a Barleybrandy. It's got aspects of a Barleywine, but so much more. Glad I got a taste of it. Not sure I could finish a large glass of this though - definitely a slow sipping and savoring beer. Unique and quite tasty."
Samuel Adams Utopias,4.65,"I opened a 2015 bottle about a month ago, this is my third pour. Time for a review.

I love how hybridized this is, it finds such a lovely grey area between beer and liquor. I can see calling this barleywine on steroids. Beautiful cogn/armagnac notes are most prominent but there is room for plenty more. Smokey wood and tobacco, raisin/plum schnapps?, plenty of brown liquor, hints of vanilla and honey, plus...just so much more. The body is wonderfully sticky and viscous.

Damn I wish I didn't like this as much as I do. There is just no way to justify buying another bottle, but this is absolutely worth trying once."
Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),4.5,"Poured from a 11.2 ounce bottle into a chalice glass, the date on bottle is ""22/11/26"" which I understand to mean is November 22, 2026. The brewery recommends drinking within 3 years of bottling so his means the beer was bottled on or about November 22, 2023. I purchased this as part of a mixed six pack from Westvleterenshop.com for USD $203.51, beer $139.00, shipping $52.99, tax $11.52. I purchased on 6-19-24 and received just eight days later in the mail on June 27, 2024.

APPEARANCE: pours a dark brown color with one-finger tan head that slowly dissipated until a thin, unbroken layer of small bubbles remained, heavy lacing on the glass, medium carbonation.

SMELL: the nose is spectacular, cola, bread, dark fruits like fig and raisin, very complex.

TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially bread and sweet cola then dark fruits like raisin and fig, the taste really lingers on the palate in a most positive way, the 8% alcohol is completely disguised.

PALATE: medium carbonation but full bodied.

OVERALL: I liked this better than Westvleteren 12, the alleged ""best beer in the world"", for Dubbel I still prefer Chimay, this is probably the second best Dubbel I have had, I don't know if I'll ever go to to Belgium but if I do will be sure to purchase this again, it's not worth what I paid but it's just money and cheaper than flying to Belgium, that's what I'm telling myself :)"
Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),4.75,"Bought at De Bierkoning in Amsterdam and drunk in a boat tour with my friends through Amsterdam channels.

Pour produced a buff head. Beer is an even walnut brown, cloudy, with amber highlights. Takes on a reddish tone towards the end as more light gets through.

Nose is rye bread, cola, raisins, plums, allspice. Understated, balanced. No bananas or yeasty funk. Dates and alcohol emerge during drinking. More esters escape as you drink as well, making this beer peak near the halfway point.

Taste is the real strong suit. Pumpernickel and mineral water base under demerera sugar, clove, and licorice. Alcohol comes forward on taste during drinking as it did on the nose. Also like the nose, the overall effect is of balance and restraint.

Feel is full and crisp. Soda-like carbonation carries a weighty brew over the tongue.

Overall, a fine brew."
Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),4.9,"Dark ruby color with a great head and lace.
aroma of dark fruits, malts and bread grains.
The taste of dark fruits, malt, chocolate.
Medium carbonation with a medium body and smooth finish.
Just a delight to drink and better with one or two years of aging."
Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),4.22,"Poured room temperature from 12oz bottle into pint glass

Overall, a fine, unpretentious brew suitable to a variety of contexts and with no true faults, but like it's monastic brewers it doesn't dazzle. Were availability or price not concerns, this beer would be just at home next to pizza and wings as it is in at a holiday dinner."
Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),4.7,"I did everything possible not to like it.

After serving it, I could still smell it from two meters away.


I tried it and although it does not reach the Westy XII the only thing I can say while I continue to dislike it is that it is simply epic, well deserved fame."
Pliny For President,4.56,"Pours a bright & effervescent gold with 2 fingers of eggshell colored head. Good lacing & above average head retention, stays effervescent throughout the pour

S: Grapefruit, grassyness, cattyness as the beer warms up

T: Follows the nose, cakey notes, & pineyness & lemons up front. Cattyness comes through once warm, a grapefruit & pronounced dryness. Finishes dry, weedy with some grapefruit keeping things in balance, just a little bready sweetness as well

MF: Medium body, smooth carbonation, great balance

This what West Coast IPAs are supposed to be, so drinkable"
Pliny For President,4.8,"500 mL bottle into a nonic pint

Wow. Take the Godfather of the modern IPA and hop it up to 11. Probably not going to love this as much as you should unless you’ve gone through a lifelong lupulin shift. Hops are as aggressive as can be without becoming unpalatable, and after a few sips, become utterly delicious.

Bouquet is dank, weedy, citrusy. Flavors start sharp and piny and zesty, and finish with a touch of honey-biscuit sweetness.


Pretty much all a seasoned hop head could ask for. Cheers!"
Pliny For President,4.39,"500mL bottle (packaged 7/9/2024) into a tulip. Pours a clear lemon yellow with a 1-finger sudsy white head.

Aroma is bright clean citrusy hops—grapefruit and pine. A touch of dank cannabis as it warms.

Taste is a blend of neutral, subtly biscuity/grainy pale/pilsner malt and lemon zest/grapefruit rind. Excellent balance between the malt and hops.

Mouthfeel is clean and crisp, medium body, super drinkable and refreshing.

Overall an outstanding IPA worthy of the Pliny name. This beer has my vote!"
Pliny For President,4.49,"Smell took me off guard in a good way, very fruity, citrusy, super complex. Tastes not as hoppy as I thought it was gonna be, but still fantastic. Not very bitter either. Great beer"
Pliny For President,3.9,"I should have read the fine print on using Simtra and Citra which are just kind of ""ok"" hops for me. Probably had too high hopes, but I was left with wanting more...hops. It started off with an ""interesting"" and went to ""I will have another beer rather than having a second can."""
Pliny For President,4.43,"(16 oz can, canned on 06/28/2024; purchased cold single at Windsor brewery... Poured into a Russian River nonic)

L: clear, yellow-gold liquid with delicate haze; tight, but spongy foam... Head don't hold well, but laces messy

S: dirty floral, German pils like herbal tick, orange pith rolled in dry grass... Musky, but with an attempt to hide the stink with perfumy soap

T: zesty-spicy salad green zip atop a fruity hop base which grows incredibly orange-juicy in the aftertaste... Slightly biscuity malt does emerge around the third sip, combining for a lemon sugar cookie note in the aft... Bitterness (and acidity) starts to take hold halfway through

F: midway through the can, and a black peppery sizzle simmers the backs of the nostrils... Flabby-plush, resinous, oily textures, with the hop bitter, pushes by booze, flinging a fiery tail into each finish

O: these are the IPAs I could drink almost all day, classic but refined... Refreshing and relatively light but with enough hop intensity and personality to thwart boredom (2330)"
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.13,"L: Pours a rich, dark, near-black chocolate that forms a thick tawny/warm tan head that is fairly quick to dissipate, revealing a spotty layer of bubbly retention and a thick ring of lacing around the edge of the snifter. Held to the light, this beer has an opaque, dark carob hue.

S: Bourbon barrel, coffee roast, oak, and char right off the bat. Follows up with some dark chocolate, burnt brown sugar, roasted malt, and a faint smattering of caramel, vanilla, and spice.

T: Follows the nose. Starts off with a shot of espresso, bourbon barrel, chocolate, and oak. There is some burnt sugar and roasted malt but it struggles to stack up against the overpowering coffee and bourbon. Lighter notes of caramel and vanilla towards the finish. Astringent.

F: Full-bodied. Sweet, smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Light carbonation.

O: Hmm. The aromas were good but the taste felt a bit off. It's a good beer but I'm less certain if I would buy it again."
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.27,"Canned November 20, 2017

This is a really nice looking and smelling beer. While the body of just about every stout I drink looks the same, the head, lacing etc. still leave room for differentiation, and it's in these ways that this one stands out. While the head isn't robust (maybe a third of an inch), it has a wonderful dark tan hue, and it really sticks to the side of the glass. The well above average lacing continues as I consume this. The aroma is rich & chocolatey but with just enough roast.

Whereas I couldn't detect any bourbon barrel on the nose, it's definitely there on the tongue. Given the age of this, I wasn't sure it would still come through, but it definitely does, albeit in a balanced way. It's the lightly bitter roast with just a little bit of sweetness on the finish that brings this all together. Full bodied with pleasant, if well disguised alcohol warming.

Overall, very good beer."
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.31,"On tap at Breakneck Tavern in Wexford, PA (2023 version).

The beer pours a deep dark brown decent head and lacing. Tastes of coffee, and bitter chocolate and barrel. Mouthfeel is decent... Alcohol is balanced. This is an above average stout. A little surprised it's on the Top 250 list, but it's nothing I'd refuse to get again - above the line, but unspectacular."
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.44,Super dark like ink. Tannish head. Decent lacing. Nose is bourbonish but more hard charr on the nose. Doesn't smell as sweet as expected. Nice partially harsh initial flavor. Good warmth.
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.36,"Appearance: Pours a completely dark, black color with a massive, deep, rich, and heavy tan head. SRM of 23. (4.50)

Aroma: Strong aromas of bourbon, chocolate, roast, coffee, vanilla. Smooth, rich, deep, and sweet.

Flavor: Strong flavors follow of rich chocolate and bourbon upfront. Smooth decidant chocolate, mixed with smooth coffee, vanilla, rich toffee, and maple syrup sweetness. Mild roastedness, and ultimatley sweet chocolate and syrup sweetness with a bourbon balance.

Feel: Heavier bodied, strong and soft carbonation to balance. Sweet, but smooth mouthfeel and hides the alcohol extremely well in the softness and smooth mouthfeel.

Overall: A World-Class rated BBA Imperial Stout. Not a big BBA person, but giving it a go. Strong chocolate, coffee, vanilla, maple syrup balanced by a smooth bourbon flavor. Incredibly smooth and soft. Hides the alcohol surprisingly well. Sometimes the bourbon and alcohol is overpowering. Not so here. Incredible Stout flavors balanced by smooth bourbon without any of the cloying alcohol or bourbon bite. Extraordinary flavors and mouthfeel. (Rating: 4.36)"
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.5,(out of the can into a sample snifter...) Tasty little thing... i think i'd like to match it up with the BA Narwhal for a blind taste-tester.

The beer pours the expected blackish brown color with excellent head retention and lots of sticky lacing all around. This beer looks great. On the nose, this beer seems a bit lacking. There's coffee, licorice and burnt toast, but without much chocolate or bourbon (which I've gotten from fresh batches in the past). The flavor profile replicates the nose, and again, I'm not getting a lot of barrel character here. Mouthfeel is still pretty good... it's fairly full with a long, fairly smooth finish. Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile, so drinkability is pretty good I guess

This is a decent ba impy stout, but it's not a stand out. There are a lot of really good ba stouts on the market, and there's really nothing exceptional about this one. Not sure this is a beer I need to revisit any time soon."
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.9,"L= Black as a moonless night. Light tan two finger head. Gorgeous lacing from a thinning but substantive collar.
S= Delicious... bourbon, chocolate, caramel, licorice, spice.
T= Hops, chocolate, bourbon, malt sugar, all forward, coffee right behind. taste varies as it rolls over tongue. Strong, luscious flavors.
F= Spot on balanced... neither watery or sticky. Perfect.
O= This is one impressive brew. I might have a new favorite here."
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.23,"It's not possible to add anything to the many thoughtful reviews of this stuff, but just for my own memory: Handsome dark brew, near black, with the beige foam and lacing in the Grand Cru goblet. Inviting aroma of cocoa and coffee. Sweet and malty with caramel and burnt sugar. The winey taste is complemented with figs and prunes. The moderate bitterness is enough to balance the sweet but keeps it highly sippable. This is my second favorite of the Big Stouts box from BA, next to the persimmon one. Not that there's much competition with all the peanut butter horrors."
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.44,"A 12 fl. oz. can, canned on 24th November 2020. Poured into a snifter glass.

Appearance: Black in colour with a nice one finger tanned head that had decent retention and left lots of nice lacing.

Aroma: Roasted malts, chocolate, dried dark fruit, prunes, fig, vanilla, and bourbon.

Taste: Roasty, chocolate, brown sugar, dried dark fruit, prunes, raisin, vanilla, oak, bourbon.

Mouthfeel: Smooth, full bodied, with soft carbonation.

Overall: A very enjoyable and complex sipper full of great flavours."
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.45,"Poured into a snifter, what was canned 01/04/23 gave a healthy 1/4-inch beige head. Wafts of vanilla and bourbon came up from the glass.
First sip: smoky coffee. Inviting. As it settles on the palate, there's an oak, espresso, burnt sugar and bourbon reveal.
It has a creamy mouthfeel and finishes smooth with a sublimated booziness, all from a 12-ounce can."
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.93,"L: Pours black like coffee with a nice creamy mocha head
S: malty, sweet molasses aroma with a hint of bourbon
T: sweet molasses, brown sugar with a hint of chocolate, bourbon and coffee
F: Smooth, like velvet. You take a sip and you want more. Not thin
O: This is what an Imperial Stout should taste like. Wonderful beer that drinks smooth and it doesn't feel like a high ABV beer. I would buy this again."
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.49,"Pours black with a surprising two fingers of brown head. It actually lasts quite a while, but eventually surrenders and becomes a few islands with a solid ring, pretty strong cling.

The smell is actually quite subdued to me. It's all there, but it doesnt seem to be eciting the glass with much urgency. Bourbon, great coffee and chocolate, roasty malts, a kind of caramel or molasses note, a light kiss of vanilla, wood.

The flavor explodes. Everything that should be in a stout of this ilk, nothing that doesn't belong, and everything in its place. Very good bourbon flavor leads the parade. There's a superbly smooth coffee taste that combines with milk chocolate for a kind of mocha effect. The chocolate lingers a bit on the lips. A little bitterness from the coffee but no acridity or unpleasant cherry taste. Not much char at all, in fact. There's a pleasing woodiness - I guess that is barrel presence. A bit of vanilla, slight touch of sweetness. Well after the swallow there is an aromatic spicy anise taste. All these flavors are extremely well-integrated.

Medium bodied, moderately carbed. It's not as dry as I thought it would be. Ultra-smooth, slightly bitter residual on the tongue while the licorice thing lingers as an aromatic. It occurs to me that it actually has a hard liquor feel to it.

I can sit here and dissect, but this beer just as easily lends itself to good old enjoyment in its totality. While the bourbon is strong, my fellow Jedi, it somehow doesn't dominate with a heavy hand. It's just unabashedly there in the foreground, but everybody else stands up loud and proud. This is some awesome sauce in a can. Well-crafted and it seems the barrel aging is flawless - deserves every bit of hype it gets, if ya ask me."
Jam The Radar,4.66,"I generally do not love fruit in any of my imperial stouts, but this was different than most. It was very smooth and balanced without being overwhelming."
Jam The Radar,4.43,"Appearance - The beer poured a luscious black color with tan bubbles, clinging to the sides of the glass.

Smell - Chocolate and raspberry were both very prominent in the nose. It was also evident that this beer was boozy.

Taste - There was a lot of chocolate in the initial taste. Juicy raspberries paired nicely with the chocolate. The berries were very realistic with nothing synthetic about them. The barrel had some bite, but also kept it from being too sweet. The chocolate lingered the longest.

Mouthfeel. - The body allowed the profile , on the back of the tongue with the dark, chocolate notes, lingering longest.

Overall - Not usually being a fan of fruited stouts, this was well done."
Jam The Radar,5.0,04/02/24 bottle @ home; 2024 vintage 14.30% ABV
Jam The Radar,4.64,"ive been a little underwhelmed by some of the bottle logic heavy hitters, not that they arent great, but just that they arent distinct enough from what others are doing to warrant the hype, and i have long thought that, albeit with just very limited experience with their stuff. that made this one even more striking i think, because as stoked as i was for it, i also had somewhat tempered expectations, but no, this is truly absurd, one of the best fruited stouts i can recall ever experiencing, and frankly its as good as it gets, rightly rated near the top of the heap, i loved every drop of it! big imperial base with some warm alcohol most of the way, more head than expected from the tap, and all the viscosity in the world, close to black but inviting rather than intimidating somehow. i think this is the 2023 vintage, not sure if there is fruit or barrel or nib variance from year to year, but this is pure fire. the nose is roasty with a big dark espresso note, some bitterness against the obvious long boiled grain sweetness. i get some tartness from the fruit, red and black raspberries, jammy decadence too, and some curious mouthwatering tartness suggesting plenty of real fruit was used, love the authenticity, and how forward it is, even though this enormous base beer. nuances of tobacco, licorice, and vanilla, but it doesnt present like a sugar bomb, and the bourbon element is smooth, regal, and woody, all so cohesive in here, unique and highly intoxicating to me. the flavor is somehow even better than the nose, luxurious bourbon abounds with honey and vanilla whispers that flatter the fruit. im amazed at some tartness being perceptible through this, the fruit part is bigtime, and it plays really well with the other elements. the nibs add a nice contrasting bitterness but also play into the overall richness, a warm baked dark chocolate brownie vibe, raspberry is so ripe and real, the darker black raspberries bring a fruit preserves aspect, and there are layers of char, coffee, and velvety cherry cordial. the fruit is so pure, the whiskey so good, the overall stout bringing them both together in such a special way, this is every bit as good as i have hoped all of these would be, and is definitely the best bottle logic beer ive ever had. the texture is weighty and smooth, the flavor is long and constantly evolving, and the whole thing is neither too sweet or too boozy to drink hard on. truly memorable! i finally get it!"
Jam The Radar,4.15,"Poured a black body with khaki head. The aroma gives off notes of woodiness (oakiness?), roasted chocolate and of course some raspberries. Smooth beer despite being fuller bodied, has a strong raspberry sweetness and bitterness along with chocolate in background. These notes balance and work together and the booze is well hidden so this beer is dangerous to drink."
Jam The Radar,4.66,"500 mL bottle into a snifter

2017 release

Well, another example of a long-cellared brew, this one on a wine rack in my relatively warm San Diego home office (aka improperly cellared) and it’s still dynamite. I had a 2022 bottle recently and this is better. The oak and raspberry and cocoa have all funneled together into singular flavor aspect that makes it dangerously drinkable. I completely understand why old school beer geeks have taken on an anti-collector, anti-ticker perspective (because they’re mostly annoying af), but the prospect that particular brews don’t improve with age is simply BS.

Find this beer if you can."
Jam The Radar,4.46,"2021 Release
550ml bottle poured into a snifter

A- pours jet black in color with a one-finger foamy khaki head that reduces to a ring around the edge

S- the glass is bursting with raspberry; raspberry jam, stewed raspberries, probably the most intense raspberry aroma i've smelled in a beer. Undertones of chocolate, vanilla & barrel that adds oak, bourbon a hint of caramel and an enhancing vanilla note

T- sweet chocolate and vanilla up front quickly gives way to bold berry notes of fresh pressed raspberry. Mid-palate brings out some oaky barrel notes that adds a caramel undertone. The finish turns tart with a blast of jammy raspberry, along with caramel and tootsie roll sticking around on the linger

M- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that turns slightly creamy into a warming finish"
Jam The Radar,4.44,"Sampling a 2021 vintage bottle poured at cellar temp into my snifter. Been in my cellar for several weeks after receipt in a trade. Label says Batch 005, not sure that means anything. My bottle also says 14.56% ABV.

The beer pours a black coffee color and very fizzy but minimal tan head foams up and is gone instantly, leaving only the thinnest of edge layers as any evidence of carbonation.
Aroma on this beer is dark chocolate, brown sugar , a bit of bourbon, but surprisingly no raspberry notes. Hops absent on the nose and booze doesnt reveal any fusol notes on the aroma.
The first sip reveals a lighter body than expected, but still in the medium range. Texture is fairly smooth and doesnt have much stickiness to it. Carbonation is very fine, sort of fleeting and borders on being still. Id say overall the physical traits are not really what I expected from a bigger imperial stout.
Flavor is chocolate bar and bourbon with a bit of cocoa powder dryness and then a blast of raspberries. WOW! That is fruity. The fruit dominates till I swallow and lingers also. Sort of a chocolate covered raspberry note with a creamy candy taste. I swear I keep getting banana, even though Im sure its the overabundance of raspberry tricking me.
Never any hop notes and the booze doesnt show up in bite or warming. Slightly dangerous, very big beer.
This in enjoyable, but if you didnt like raspberries, you may not like it. I enjoy them and grow my own each summer. Glad to have tried this beer."
Double Dry Hopped Double Citra Daydream,4.43,"Good beer, good NEIPA. Light opaque golden yellow color with a white head as is typical with Other Half IPAs. Smooth taste with plentiful tropical and citrus notes. The oatmeal adds a sweet character to it. Nice and tropical and smooth just as expected."
Double Dry Hopped Double Citra Daydream,4.19,"Poured from 16oz can into my BeerAdvocate teku. Canned 4/25/24. A palindrome!

Appearance: super thicc and hazy medium yellow hue with a thick finger of frothy ivory foam with a good retention and leaving a good lace on the glass.

Smell: slightly dank, slightly grassy, with a hint of slightly sharp citrus hops. Not bad, certainly, but not totally outstanding.

Taste: sweet malt helps this beer along, with a mild passionfruit character alongside a mild stone fruit character. It’s juicy and tasty, if not, maybe, the brightest hazy IPA I’ve had. It’s got a lot more going on than the aroma, though.

Mouthfeel: medium-rich body with a really good level of carboantion and creaminess. Very nice.

Overall: a solid beer! Evidently I don’t love it as much as the rest of BeerAdvocate but overall this is a very tasty beer and a good, if not stellar, NEIPA."
Double Dry Hopped Double Citra Daydream,4.32,"Hazy pale yellow colour. Smell is sweet citrus, very citra. Taste is the same, smooth rich feel, rather sweet. No discernible bitterness. Nice stuff, but not worth the price to me."
Double Dry Hopped Double Citra Daydream,4.42,"Canned 2/6/24. Poured a hazy pale gold; tight white head; good cap retention; bands of soapy lace. Nose is grapefruit, orange and lemon. Taste follows nose; firm malt base; no bitterness. Medium full (oats/lactose) body; soft, almost fluffy feel; light carbonation; no astringency. Overall, a tasty citrus flavored hazy light with a pleasing mouthfeel that is not too pillowy."
Double Dry Hopped Double Citra Daydream,4.58,"Look - Fantastic thick orangish tan with a nice thick white head rimming and lacing
Smell - So much citrus orange oat
Taste - Orange slight peach with a nice oat backbone
Feel - Medium full body creamy very light carb
Overall - Really fantastic!"
Double Dry Hopped Double Citra Daydream,4.0,"16oz can from Tavour. Orange peach pour, patchy white head, lacing. Citrus, tropical aroma, light floral notes. Taste is fruity, melon, tropical, dry, light bitterness. For a Citra IPA, citrus is the lowest on the totem pole for this brew."
Double Dry Hopped Double Citra Daydream,4.22,"Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass.

Murky and opaque but not quite turbid dull lemon body. Kind of fleeting with a light lemon meringue pie custard look with a solid appearance. Bright white creamy forming head of thee fingers, and lots of solid cling and chunky lacing.

Bursting hop aroma. Dank earth with sweet spice tones and mixing bold citrus flavors of hop all at once. Dank orange peel madness is what it seems like in a can with a neutral malt presence to let everything shine. There's a touch of sugar here as well on the nose.

Kind of an interesting but unexpected experience. Light bodied but flirting with a real sense of wet mouthfeel. Rushing and very diverse hop flavors. Tropical sensing pineapple, spiced up herbs, and a slight touch of sweet milk seems to rush on first sip. Diversity still continues in the finish, pine and earth like richness with bitterness that mixes with a light touch of cream lactose for an added cut to the senses.

Still overall it comes off as just really solid, even crushable, but not mind blowing."
Double Dry Hopped Double Citra Daydream,4.5,"poured from a 16oz can into a narrow gauge stemless wine glass. pours a thick, hazy orange with two fingers of fluffy white foam head. tons of candied orange on the nose as well as peach and even some grass. taste follows with an incredibly smooth finish for 8.5%. big, thick mouthfeel. really good DIPA. not too shocking coming from OH. they kill this style."
Double Dry Hopped Double Citra Daydream,4.71,"How have I not rated this yet? Canned 6/26. Pale gold and cloudy, light head and lacing. Citrusy and dank scents. Bright tangy citrusy flavors, but it’s not over the top. Medium bodied, subtle alcohol presence. Just plain excellent."
Double Dry Hopped Double Citra Daydream,4.79,"I figured it out! Other Half made a deal with the devil!

Seriously, this brewery can do no wrong. If you can get their beers, do it now, because this seems like something that can't last. AMBEV is going to buyout this brewery and start producing mediocre IPAs to capitalize on the brand while they can. If there's anything I've learned after half a century on this planet, it's that extreme excellence cannot endure in the mortal realm.

Does the Double Dry Hopped Double Citra Daydream match my previous Other Half favorite, Citra + Mosaic? I'd have to match them head-to-head to be sure, but I think it exceeds its predecessor. There's just a tiny touch of sweetness that elevates this hoppy masterpiece above C+M. Maybe. If you can put one of each in front of me, I'll let you know for sure, and thank you enthusiastically in the process. The worst Other Half ales would easily qualify as the best beers of many other brewers. That is not an exaggeration. I've been enjoying everything I've bought from them in the last six months, and the Daydream may be a new pinnacle.

At this point, I should be giving you tasting notes and that kind of stuff. Nah. Just drink it yourself. It's a great NEIPA. Plato himself would call this a platonic NEIPA. Smooth. Citrusy. Smooth. Delicious. I'd give this a 5 on all accounts, but I want to give myself a little room in case God Himself decides to open a brewery. You never know."

Really smooth palate for the higher ABV.  Probably not to the level of the Vietnamese version (my absolute favorite) or regular Speedway but still very very good.  It's hard to go wrong with Speedway, although a few of the varieties can sometimes push the sweetness limits.  This one is not in that category."
AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,4.3,"Aromas are a little bit of an odd mix of molasses, funk, roast and dark malt.

Ízében hozza az illatfelhő gazdagságát, csoki, kávé, kakaó, aszalt sötét gyümölcsök, vanília, bourbon, karamell. Testes, enyhén szénsavas, közepesen keserű. Az ízek egymásba simulnak, az…"

Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),4.0,.355 in Kroken while trying to enjoy Manchester United's Europa League visit to the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán stadium. While I am arguably late to the party Founders' products have increasingly become my go-to brewery over the last couple of years due to the nigh on unbeatable combination of relatively low cost and - crucially - consistently very high quality of their products.

Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),4.5,"Pours absolutely pitch black (I put a flashlight against the other side of the glass.  Nothing.) with a thick chocolate milk colored head that is in no hurry to go anywhere.  Aroma is chocolate croissant with roasted grain and nuts.

Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),4.1,"Ondoorzichtig zwart bier met een kleine bruine schuimkraag. Geur van koffie is het meest prominent, maar ook de bourbon en de vanille komen naar voren. De cacao en eiken haalde ik er niet uit. De smaak wordt ondersteund door een zijdezacht mondgevoel met net genoeg koolzuur. Ook hier spelen koffie en bourbon de hoofdrol."
Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),3.5,"Nice enough stout. Easily replicated and bettered by countless craft breweries, but if you can get a bottle why not. The 100 score is just reputation overdrive."
