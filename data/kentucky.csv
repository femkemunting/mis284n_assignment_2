Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,4.61,"Sampled at the brewery, this is the 2022 bottle version.

The beer pours a viscous, blackish brown color with light brownish lacing and good head retention. This beer pours like motor oil, and has the look of a beer that has seen some serious barrel aging (which I assume it has). The nose is rich and decadent, showcasing maple syrup, dark chocolate, chocolate brownie, vanilla, light coffee and noticeable bourbon. This smells like it might be pretty good, albeit very sweet and rich. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, with the maple syrup, vanilla and bourbon taking center stage. This beer is very sweet with quite a bit of maple flavor, which is perhaps its only flaw. Mouthfeel is very full, with a long, soft finish. The beer comes across as very viscous on the palate. Carbonation is fairly low, which I think works well with the mouthfeel in this beer. The finish in this beer goes on forever. Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile, though the abv is actually relatively low for a ba stout these days. In any event, while you can tell the abv is up there in this beer, there's no heat or off flavors from the alcohol.

Obviously, this is an excellent BA impy stout. Does is justify the hype and price tag? Can't answer that. Depends on the consumer I suppose. All I'll say is that it's a a very good beer and one I'm happy to have tried."
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,4.71,"The perfect barrel aged stout. Not overly sweet, nice barrel notes with coffee and maple. Just delish!"
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,5.0,"The flirtation with maple comes to a crescendo in Toppling Goliath's imperial maple, coffee and bourbon barrel aged stout.

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout shows that something special is up when it pours with an inky impression of black brandy equipped with sticky legging swirling around an ominously still beer. As a sultry, savory and oh-so seductive scent pulls from the onyx-black beer, the mouth waters with the scent of espresso, dark chocolate, maple, sweet bourbon and port wine. Expectedly sweet, the toasty malts bring out the flavor of maple-dipped chocolate, chocolate covered espresso bean, bourbon ball candies and whisky laced molasses.

Bold, savory, sweet and mouth coating on the middle palate, the boldness of the stout remains in check while the more roasty edges pull from the sweetness with espresso roast, toasty, smoky and baker's chocolate that all trend spicy, lightly bitter and balancing with a chest warming offset of bourbon and all of its caramel, vanilla, toasted oak and peppery whisky flavors in closure.

Obviously full, rich and lavishly malted from start to finish, the stout finishes on a drying track in an off-pastry mouthfeel of spice, light bitterness and port-like warmth. It's a masterful stout that belongs on such lofty pedestals."

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,4.98,"On tap at TG for part of KBBS release day - rating 2023 version; perfect black color. This is an amazing blend richness, dessert and coffee; the barrel is perfectly complimentary and not overpowering. The sweetness is palatable rather than making your teeth hurt. The mouthfeel is thick and silky. Overall, one of the best beers I've had."
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,4.7,"Perfect black color. I didn't see much foam, other than a brown ring. The smell is a perfect blend of maple, coffee, chocolate, and bourbon. The taste is strong with maple. Almost too strong. Chocolate follows, with coffee, bourbon, and vanilla. It is very sweet. The mouthfeel is thick, smooth, lucious, and full. Very nice. Overall, this is a wonderful beer, but there is too much maple flavor for it to be one of my favorite beers."
