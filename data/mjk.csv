M.J.K.,4.94,"Wow, I stumbled into Side Project and they were offering 1oz, $6 pours of M.J.K. I ordered a 4oz pour. To say the beer is fantastic is an understatement.
Look: Deep amber similar to Dark Brandy
Smell: Dark fruit, toffee and booze. Amazing sweet smell lingers on the nose.
Taste: Taste is off the charts, toffee, dark fruit, not too boozy or sweet. Perfection!
Feel: Medium thickness, velvety on the tongue.
Overall: This is hands down the best Barley-wine, and one of the best beers I've ever had. For me, Side Project is only a four hour drive to St. Louis. I would have no trouble making it a regular monthly destination."

M.J.K.,4.53,"Insanely good for the style. Fantastic blend of bourbon barrels, with some barleywine sweetness and dark fruit. Deep, dark ruby-copper brown with no head, and not much carbonation."
M.J.K.,4.7,"A special gift for a special moment. This did not disappoint. The darkest brown can be, brown ring. Aromas of caramel, toffee, molasses, raisin, and bourbon explode off this one, dark oak, char, leather, barley dry earth, and a touch of cocoa and anise in the background, incredibly complex. Taste has more barrel focus with the rustic wood, bourbon, earthy char and chocolate all rise to meet the level of the toffee and dark fruit, with toasted caramel, barley, and leather support. Feel is massive and heavy, also very warm but never hot, leans more malty than barley."
M.J.K.,5.0,Absolute phenomenal brew. Super complex. Perfect in every way. It was the star of our beercation to Side Project.
