Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,4.61,"Sampled at the brewery, this is the 2022 bottle version.

The beer pours a viscous, blackish brown color with light brownish lacing and good head retention. This beer pours like motor oil, and has the look of a beer that has seen some serious barrel aging (which I assume it has). The nose is rich and decadent, showcasing maple syrup, dark chocolate, chocolate brownie, vanilla, light coffee and noticeable bourbon. This smells like it might be pretty good, albeit very sweet and rich. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, with the maple syrup, vanilla and bourbon taking center stage. This beer is very sweet with quite a bit of maple flavor, which is perhaps its only flaw. Mouthfeel is very full, with a long, soft finish. The beer comes across as very viscous on the palate. Carbonation is fairly low, which I think works well with the mouthfeel in this beer. The finish in this beer goes on forever. Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile, though the abv is actually relatively low for a ba stout these days. In any event, while you can tell the abv is up there in this beer, there's no heat or off flavors from the alcohol.

Obviously, this is an excellent BA impy stout. Does is justify the hype and price tag? Can't answer that. Depends on the consumer I suppose. All I'll say is that it's a a very good beer and one I'm happy to have tried."
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,4.71,"The perfect barrel aged stout. Not overly sweet, nice barrel notes with coffee and maple. Just delish!"
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,5.0,"The flirtation with maple comes to a crescendo in Toppling Goliath's imperial maple, coffee and bourbon barrel aged stout.

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout shows that something special is up when it pours with an inky impression of black brandy equipped with sticky legging swirling around an ominously still beer. As a sultry, savory and oh-so seductive scent pulls from the onyx-black beer, the mouth waters with the scent of espresso, dark chocolate, maple, sweet bourbon and port wine. Expectedly sweet, the toasty malts bring out the flavor of maple-dipped chocolate, chocolate covered espresso bean, bourbon ball candies and whisky laced molasses.

Bold, savory, sweet and mouth coating on the middle palate, the boldness of the stout remains in check while the more roasty edges pull from the sweetness with espresso roast, toasty, smoky and baker's chocolate that all trend spicy, lightly bitter and balancing with a chest warming offset of bourbon and all of its caramel, vanilla, toasted oak and peppery whisky flavors in closure.

Obviously full, rich and lavishly malted from start to finish, the stout finishes on a drying track in an off-pastry mouthfeel of spice, light bitterness and port-like warmth. It's a masterful stout that belongs on such lofty pedestals."

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,4.98,"On tap at TG for part of KBBS release day - rating 2023 version; perfect black color. This is an amazing blend richness, dessert and coffee; the barrel is perfectly complimentary and not overpowering. The sweetness is palatable rather than making your teeth hurt. The mouthfeel is thick and silky. Overall, one of the best beers I've had."
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,4.7,"Perfect black color. I didn't see much foam, other than a brown ring. The smell is a perfect blend of maple, coffee, chocolate, and bourbon. The taste is strong with maple. Almost too strong. Chocolate follows, with coffee, bourbon, and vanilla. It is very sweet. The mouthfeel is thick, smooth, lucious, and full. Very nice. Overall, this is a wonderful beer, but there is too much maple flavor for it to be one of my favorite beers."
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,5.0,"Amazing stout, expensive but worth the price!"
M.J.K.,4.94,"Wow, I stumbled into Side Project and they were offering 1oz, $6 pours of M.J.K. I ordered a 4oz pour. To say the beer is fantastic is an understatement.
Look: Deep amber similar to Dark Brandy
Smell: Dark fruit, toffee and booze. Amazing sweet smell lingers on the nose.
Taste: Taste is off the charts, toffee, dark fruit, not too boozy or sweet. Perfection!
Feel: Medium thickness, velvety on the tongue.
Overall: This is hands down the best Barley-wine, and one of the best beers I've ever had. For me, Side Project is only a four hour drive to St. Louis. I would have no trouble making it a regular monthly destination."
M.J.K.,5.0,2021
M.J.K.,4.89,"Mjk 2024
31 to 32 mos in willet family estate bourbon & Brazilian amburana barrels
Look - super dark brown slight rimming great lacing
Smell and taste - so much woody barrel, cinnamon, boozy, toffee and chocolate
Feel - for a bw, great full body slight carb"
M.J.K.,4.53,"Insanely good for the style. Fantastic blend of bourbon barrels, with some barleywine sweetness and dark fruit. Deep, dark ruby-copper brown with no head, and not much carbonation."
M.J.K.,4.7,"A special gift for a special moment. This did not disappoint. The darkest brown can be, brown ring. Aromas of caramel, toffee, molasses, raisin, and bourbon explode off this one, dark oak, char, leather, barley dry earth, and a touch of cocoa and anise in the background, incredibly complex. Taste has more barrel focus with the rustic wood, bourbon, earthy char and chocolate all rise to meet the level of the toffee and dark fruit, with toasted caramel, barley, and leather support. Feel is massive and heavy, also very warm but never hot, leans more malty than barley."
M.J.K.,5.0,Absolute phenomenal brew. Super complex. Perfect in every way. It was the star of our beercation to Side Project.
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.93,"Batch 11 - 2023 (black wax) - just a superb beer. Pours a deep, dark brown color with an amazing nose of barrel and caramel / sweetness. Taste hits you with perfect balance; that's what sets this apart - it's as if the entire beer plays nice with all of its parts, intense flavors of barrel, sweetness, raisin and caramel, complimented by dark fruit and brown sugar.
I might say it's a smidge thin for me, but that's if I'm TRYING to find a flaw. It's the embodiment of a perfect BA barleywine, IMO. Right up there with MJK and 10 Yr BW from SP. I think 10 Yr BW edges this out by the narrowest of margins, but let's be honest, I'm not turning either down given the chance to have it again. What a beverage. One of those beers that you were almost pissed that you decided to split it instead of solo-doming. :)"
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.86,"Briljant beer and worth searching for.
In the nose - a really nice and complex smell that longs for another sniff.
Taste- complex, sweet but not overwhelming, caramel, tannins and vanilla from the barrel.
Overall- excellent flavor and taste, not unbalanced in anyway."
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.73,"Thank you to noblepudding, a prince among traders, for sending this fancy, gold-waxed bottle to the northern steppes. 375ML, Batch #7.

The pour is a muddied brown-red with the expected lack of bubbles. The nose is a sharp spike of bourbon & booze.

A Deal with the Devil â€“ Triple Oaked is a multi-layered beast. The booze is off the charts for a malt-based product & the bourbon exhale is spectacular; if I drank the stuff I suspect I could pull some of the various bottles out of the layers. Underneath that glorious noise is black, bruised, sweet fruit just on the edge of gone, molasses, achingly sweet, before the desiccated oak brings it home. Shame this bottle is so small. I have lots of sick/vacation time to use on three of these in a night.

Well, damn. Anchorage rarely misses on their big bottles & they better not based on the price point. This is transcendent."
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.87,"Pours a deep, dark brown color. Aroma is an amazing, complex combination of dark fruits, oak, bourbon with hints of caramel and a tad bit of coconut. Taste follows nose but with more intensity of flavor and sweetness -- the dark fruits (fig and plums), brown sugar, caramel, bourbon and the oak. So very balance and very present in the taste without distracting from the other flavors. Full bodied, traditional ADWTD mouthfeel. Incredible barleywine and worth the wait."
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.6,"2021 batch 3, drank in June 2022. Didn't get as much from this as previous ADWTD. Felt sweet without complexity that you would expect. Still very delicious, just not worth the price."
